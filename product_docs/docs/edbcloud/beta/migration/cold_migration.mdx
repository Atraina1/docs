title: Importing an existing Postgres database
---

The simplest way to import a database in EDB Cloud is using logical backups taken with `pg_dump` and loaded using `pg_restore`. This approach provides a way to export and import a database across different versions of Postgres, including exporting from PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server versions prior to 10.

The high-level steps are:

1. Export existing roles 
1. Import existing roles
1. For each database, you are migrating:
   a. logical export using `pg_dump`
   b. import with `pg_restore`


## Is this the approach for you?

This approach requires suspension of write operations to the database application for the duration of the export/import process. The write operations can then be resumed on the new system. This is because `pg_dump` takes an online snapshot of the source database. As a result, the changes after the backup starts are not included in the output.

The required downtime depends on many factors, including:
 - Size of the database
 - Speed of the network between the two systems
 - Your team's familiarity with the migration procedure. 
 
 To minimize the downtime, you can test the process as many times as needed before the actual migration, as the export with `pg_dump` can be performed online and the process is repeatable and measurable.

## Before you begin

Ensure you: 
 - Understand the terminology conventions
 - Have the required Postgres client libraries
 - Can access the source and target database

### Terminology conventions

| Term | Alias | Definition | 
| ---- | ----- | ---------- |
| source database |  

### Postgres client libraries
Install the Postgres version of the target database of the following client libraries on the source host:

- `pg_dumpall`
- `pg_dump`
- `pg_restore`
- `psql`

For example, if you want to import a PostgreSQL 9.6 database from your private network into a PostgreSQL 13 database in EDB Cloud, use the client libraries and binaries from version 13.

### Access to the source and target database

PostgreSQL superuser access to the source database on host `pg-source` (this could be the `postgres` user or another user with `SUPERUSER` privileges)
Access to the target database instance on host `pg-target` in EDB Cloud as `edb_admin` user
