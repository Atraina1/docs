EDB provides migration tools to bring data into EDB Cloud such as Migration Portal and Migration Toolkit. 

See [The Migration Process](../../../migration_toolkit/latest/03_migration_methodology/) in the [Migration Toolkit documentation](../../../migration_toolkit/latest) for a high-level description of the migration path to Postgres. 

The [Migration Portal documentation](../../../migration_portal/latest) provides the details for executing the migration steps using Migration Portal: 

 1. [Schema extraction](../.../../migration_portal/latest/04_mp_migrating_database/01_mp_schema_extraction/)
 1. [Schema assessment](../../../migration_portal/latest/04_mp_migrating_database/02_mp_schema_assessment/)
 1. [Schema migration](../../../migration_portal/latest/04_mp_migrating_database/03_mp_schema_migration/)
 1. [Data migration](../../../migration_portal/latest/04_mp_migrating_database/04_mp_data_migration/)
   
   The Migration Portal documentation describes how to use Marketing Toolkit for the data migration step. This is a good option for smaller databases. EDB has other migration tools such as [Replication Server](../../../eprs/latest/) for ongoing migrations and [LiveCompare](../../../livecompare/latest/) to do data comparisons. Contact Professional Services for more information on these options.

For a simple way to import an existing Postgres database into EDB Cloud, see [Importing an existing Postgres database](cold_migration).
