title: "Creating a Cluster"
---
!!! Note
Prior to creating your cluster, make sure you have adequate Azure resources or your request to create a cluster will fail. See [Raising Your Azure Resource Limits](01_check_resource_limits).
!!!


To create a cluster:

1. Sign in to the [EDB Cloud](https://portal.edbcloud.com) portal.

3. Select **Create New Cluster** in the top right of the **Overview** page or **Clusters** page. The **Create Cluster** page opens.
4. Specify the cluster settings on the following tabs of the **Create Cluster** page:
   - [**Cluster Info**](#cluster-info)

   - [**Operational Settings**](#operational-settings)
   - [**DB Configuration** ](#db-configuation) (optional)
   - [ **Availibility** ](#availibility) (optional)

8. Select **Create Cluster**. It might take a few minutes to deploy.

!!! Note
    When you elect not to configure settings on optional tabs, the default values are used.

## Cluster Info
1. Enter the name for your cluster in the **Cluster Name** field.

2. Enter a password for your cluster in the **Password** field. This will be the password for the user edb_admin.
3. Select **Next: Operational Settings**

## Operational Settings
1. In the **Database Type** section,
   1. Select the type of Postgres you want to use in the **Postgres Type** field:
      - [*PostgreSQL*](../../../supported-open-source/postgresql/) is an open-source object-relational database management system.

      - [*EDB Postgres Advanced Server*](../../../epas/latest/) is EDB’s secure, Oracle-compatible PostgreSQL.

   2. Select the version of Postgres that you want to use in the **Version** field. See [Database Version Policy](../overview/05_database_version_policy) for more information.
2. Select the cloud provider for your cluster in the **Provider** field.
   !!! Note
       Microsoft Azure is the only option for the Preview.
3. Select the region where you want your cluster to be deployed in the **Region** field. For the best performance, EDB typically recommends that this region should be the same as other resources you have that communicate with your cluster.
4. In the the **Instance Type** section, select the number of vCPUs and amount of memory you desire.
5. In the **Storage** section, select **Volume Type**, and in **Volume Properties** the type and amount of storage needed for your cluster.
   !!! Note
       EDB Cloud currently supports Azure Premium SSD storage types. See [the Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#premium-ssd) for more information.
6. In the **Networking** section, Whether to use private or public networking using the **Networking** slide button. Networking is set to Public by default. Public means that any client can connect to your cluster’s public IP address over the internet.
Private networking allows only IP addresses within your private network to connect to your cluster.
7. Select **Next: DB Configuration**

## DB Configuration
In the **Parameters** section, you could overwrite any of [GUC variables](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/what-guc-variable). You can navigate the list of parameters using filters and pagination or you can use **Search**.

The list of parameters is populated based on your **Database Type** selection. 
* If you have chosen  *PostgreSQL*  you can find the reference documentation for available parameters [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/config-setting.html) and [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config.html).
* If you have chosen *EDB Postgres Advanced Server*  you can find the reference documentation for available parameters [here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/epas_guide/03_database_administration/01_configuration_parameters/02_summary_of_configuration_parameters/#summary_of_configuration_parameters) and [here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/epas_guide/03_database_administration/01_configuration_parameters/).

After configuring GUC parameters, select **Next: Availability**

## Availability
 Enable or disable high availability using the **High Availability** slide button. High availability is enabled by default.
 When high availability is enabled, clusters are configured with one primary and two replicas with synchronous streaming replication.
 Clusters are configured across availability zones in regions with availability zones. When high availability is disabled, only one instance is provisioned.
 See [Supported Architectures](../overview/02_high_availibility) for more information.

## What’s Next

Now that you’ve created your cluster, here are some additional resources for cluster use and management:

* [Using your Cluster]( ../using_cluster/)
* [Managing Postgres Access](../../administering_cluster/02_postgres_access/)
