title: Creating a Private Networking Cluster
---
  

You can deploy your cluster in a private network. A private cluster restricts access to the PostgreSQL service from outside the network. You can use access control to allow selected access from other networks and the internet.

When you create your first cluster, EDB Cloud deploys a dedicated virtual network in Azure for all your resources.

The virtual network or VNet is named after the region where the cluster is deployed `vnet-{azure-location}`. For example, if the EDB Cloud Cluster is deployed in the East US region, it is named `vnet-eastus`.

For each subsequent private cluster added in the same region,
EDB Cloud adds the following additional network infrastructure:

- An Azure Standard SKU Internal Load Balancer (ILB) named `kubernetes-internal`
  
  The ILB connects to the EDB Postgres service through the virtual network private IP. The ILB service is exclusively available for resources in the virtual network. 

   In the Azure CLI, you can list this ILB by using the following command:

   ```
   $ az network lb list --query "[?name=='kubernetes-internal' && location=='japaneast']" -o table
   Name                 Location    ResourceGuid                          ProvisioningState    ResourceGroup
   -------------------  ----------  ------------------------------------  -------------------  ---------------
   kubernetes-internal  japaneast   763196da-e0ae-4ad5-a160-9c15c091ec20  Succeeded            mc_dp-brcxzr08qr7rbei1-aks-japaneast-0_japaneast

- A public DNS zone for the EDB Cloud cluster
  
  Note that you can resolve a domain name from inside or outside of the virtual network. 
Â  However, for a private EDB Cloud resource, the DNS resolves to a private IP address, which cannot be accessed from outside the virtual network.

   Example of a public DNS:
   `p-c4ia6jleig40jngmac40.brcxzr08qr7rbei1.edbcloud.io`
