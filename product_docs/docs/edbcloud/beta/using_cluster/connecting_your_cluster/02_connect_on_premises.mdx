title: Connecting from Networks Outside Azure
---


If your applications are deployed on your on-premises environments, or on other Cloud providers instead Azure, you can set up a secure tunnel between your on premises network and the Azure virtual network. 

There are a few options you can use.

## Connecting Using Azure VPN Gateway (Point-to-Site)

Azure VPN gateway provides you an encrypted tunnel to communicate
with your IT infrastructures on a Azure Private Network over complex
network environments like the internet.

Point-to-Site VPN connections are useful when you want to connect to
your EDB Cloud cluster from a remote location, such as when you do
administrative operations from home. You can also use P2S instead of a
Site-to-Site VPN when you have only a few clients that need to connect
to your EDB Cloud service. Point-to-Site connections do not require a VPN
device or a public-facing IP address. P2S creates the VPN connection
over either SSTP (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol) or IKEv2 protocol.

The Azure resources that are created when you create a virtual network
gateway include:

-   A VM that is deployed in your EDB Cloud cluster virtual network. It works as a VPN application to handle all traffic.

-   A dedicated subnet called `GatewaySubnet` to accommodate the VPN VM.

## Point-to-Site Example

These are the steps to connect using the Azure VPN Gateway Point-to-Site option. 

### Step 1: Create Virtual Network VPN Gateway

 In the **Virtual network gateway** page, create the first VPN gateway for the EDB Cloud Cluster resource virtual network `vnet-japaneast`. Name the VPN gateway "vpng-edbcloud."

!!! Note
    The VPN gateway automatically creates a dedicated subnet to accommodate its gateway VMs. Ensure that your EDB Cloud virtual network address space has sufficient IP range for the subnet to prevent errors in the virtual network.


### Step 2: Create self-signed root CA for your VPN gateway authentication

Certificates are used by Azure to authenticate clients connecting to a
VNet over a Point-to-Site VPN connection. See
[Generate a Self-Signed Root
Certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal#getcer).
This example uses a self-signed certificate, but EDB recommends you use your Enterprise certificate in
production.

### Step 3: Point-to-site configuration in EDB Cloud VPN gateway

Configure a point-to-site (P2S) connection for VPN gateway `vpng-edbcloud` from the Azure virtual network
gateway portal. See [Create the VPN gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal#creategw).

-   **Address pool** - the reserved private IP address pool for every client connected through VPN gateway. It should be in your virtual network IP range, but not overlap with subnets in use.

-   **Tunnel type** - most client systems prefer IKEv2, then fall back to SSTP.

-   **Authentication type** - choose your Azure certificate and use the certificates we created in [step 2](step-2-create-self-signed-root-ca-for-your-vpn-gateway-authentication).

-   **Root certificate** - update your self-signed root CA here. It must be in X509 text format. The VPN gateway uses your root CA to
 verify client certificates.

See [configuration
details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal#addresspool).

### Step 4: Configure your VPN client app to connect to EDB Cloud virtual network

Select **Download VPN client** to download the configuration files for P2S certificate
authentication. It is a downloadable zip file that contains all the manifests required 
for setting up your VPN client in different operating systems.

For details, see the [configuration guide for
VPN clients](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-vpn-client-configuration-azure-cert)
of different operating systems.

## Other Enterprise-level Solutions

There are other enterprise-level connectivity solutions that have
higher bandwidth and throughputs. However, they have a higher cost and need
dedicated devices or private circuits from internet providers. Refer to the following links for more information.
