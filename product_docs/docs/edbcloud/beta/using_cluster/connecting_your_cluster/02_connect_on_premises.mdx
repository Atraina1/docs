title: Connecting from an On-Premises Network
---


Sometimes customers' applications are deployed on their on-premise
environments, or on other Cloud providers instead Azure, but they also
want to consume private EDB Cloud service from these premises via a
secure approach. In these cases, customers can set up a secure tunnel
between their premise network and Azure virtual network. Here we list a
few options you can use.

## Connect Using Azure VPN Gateway (Point-to-Site)

Azure VPN gateway provides customer an encrypted tunnel to communicate
with your IT infrastructures on Azure private network over complex
network environments like the internet.

Point-to-Site VPN connections are useful when you want to connect to
your EDB Cloud cluster from a remote location, such when you do
administrative operation from home. You can also use P2S instead of a
Site-to-Site VPN when you have only a few clients that need to connect
to your EDB Cloud service. Point-to-Site connections do not require a VPN
device or a public-facing IP address. P2S creates the VPN connection
over either SSTP (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol), or IKEv2 protocal.

The resources a virtual network VPN gateway

The Azure resources that are created when you create a virtual network
gateway include:

-   A VM that is deployed in your EDB Cloud cluster virtual network, it will work as a VPN application to handle all traffics.

-   A dedicated subnet called "GatewaySubnet" to accommodate the VPN VM.

### Step 1: Create Virtual Network VPN Gateway

See [Connect Using Azure VNET-VNET Connection](#connect-using-azure-vnet-vnet-connection) step 1 to create
a VPN Gateway called `vpng-edbcloud` for EDB Cloud virtual network
`vnet-japaneast`. You can do this from the "Virtual network gateways"
resource portal.

### Step 2: Create self-signed root CA for your VPN gateway authentication

Certificates are used by Azure to authenticate clients connecting to a
VNet over a Point-to-Site VPN connection. See
[Generate a Self-Signed Root
Certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal#getcer),
We use a self-signed certificate in this example, but in real
production, you are recommended to use your Enterprise certificate.

### Step 3: Point-to-site configuration in EDB Cloud VPN gateway

Configure a point-to-site (P2S) connection for VPN gateway `vpng-edbcloud` from the Azure virtual network
gateway portal,see [Create the VPN gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal#creategw).

-   **Address pool**, is the reserved private IP address pool for every client connected through VPN gateway. It should be in your virtual network IP range, but not overlap with subnets in use.

-   **Tunnel type**, most client systems prefer IKEv2, then falls back to SSTP.

-   **Authentication type**, choose Azure certificate and use the certificates we created in step 2 late on.

-   **Root certificate**, update your self-signed root CA here, it must be in X509 text format. then VPN gateway uses your root CA to
 verify client certificates.

See [configuration
details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal#addresspool).

### Step 4: Configure your VPN client app to connect to EDB Cloud virtual network

After you have configured the "point-to-site configuration" in step 3, you
can download "VPN client configuration files for P2S certificate
authentication". It is a downloadable zip file that contains all the manifests required 
for setting up your VPN client in different operating systems.

VPN clients](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-vpn-client-configuration-azure-cert)
of different operating systems.

## Other Enterprise-level Solutions

There are other enterprise-level connectivity solutions that have
higher bandwidth and throughputs. However, they have higher cost and need
dedicated devices or private circuits from internet providers. Refer to the following links for more information.
