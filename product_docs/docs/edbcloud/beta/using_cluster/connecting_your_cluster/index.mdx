You can connect to your cluster using [`psql`](http://postgresguide.com/utilities/psql.html), the terminal-based client for Postgres, or another client. See [Recommended Settings for SSL Mode](#recommended-settings-for-ssl-mode) for EDB's recommendations for secure connections.

## Using `psql`
To connect to your cluster using `psql`:
1. Sign in to the [EDB Cloud](https://portal.edbcloud.com) portal.

1. Go to the [**Clusters**](https://portal.edbcloud.com/clusters) page.

3. Select the name of your cluster.
4. On the **Overview** tab, select the copy icon to the right of the **Quick Connect** field to copy the command for connecting to your cluster using `psql` to your clipboard. `psql` will prompt for the edb_admin user password you selected at cluster creation time.
5. Paste the command in your terminal.

## Using Another Client
To connect to your cluster using a client other than `psql`:
1. Sign in to the [EDB Cloud](https://portal.edbcloud.com) portal.

1. Go to the [**Clusters**](https://portal.edbcloud.com/clusters) page.

2. Select the name of your cluster.
3. Select the **Connect** tab. You can review and copy all the relevant information you need from this screen except for the edb_admin user password. Please consult the client driver documentation for the connection string format the driver uses.

## Recommended Settings for SSL Mode

Different clients can have different default TLS/SSL modes (sslmode). For example, `psql` defaults to `prefer`, which means the client will attempt to establish a TLS connection but fall back to non-TLS if the server does not support it. In the `psql` example provided by EDB in the **Quick Connect** field, `sslmode` is explicitly set to `require`, which means the client will attempt a TLS connection and fail if the connection to the server can't be encrypted.

For public connections and in most environments, EDB recommends setting `sslmode` to `verify-full`. This ensures that you connect to the server you specified and that the connection is encrypted. EDB Cloud generates certificates with LetsEncrypt, a widely trusted certificate authority. Your client machine may already have a bundled CA certificate for LetsEncrypt, for example, at `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` or `/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem`. If it doesn't, your client machine needs a [CA certificate for Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/). Once the CA certificate is in place on your client machine, configure the `sslrootcert` parameter to its location and set the `sslmode` parameter to `verify-full` to verify the certificate to fully validate the connection:

```
psql -W "postgres://edb_admin@xxxxxxxxx.xxxxx.edbcloud.io:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=verify-full&sslrootcert=/usr/share/ca-certificates/isrgrootx1.pem"
```

Once connected to the cluster using `psql`, the `conninfo` meta-command shows the encryption protocol being used for communication. In the case of EDB Cloud,  TLS (v1.2+) is supported:

```
edb_admin=> \conninfo
You are connected to database "edb_admin" as user "edb_admin" on host "xxxxxxxxx.xxxxx.edbcloud.io" at port "5432".
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
```

## Setting up Azure Infrastructure to Connect to a Private Network Cluster

The Private Networking option offers a higher level of isolation and security to your EDB Cloud cluster. Clusters, with Private Networking enabled, are not accessible from outside of your EDB Cloud resource virtual network. Only resources from the same virtual network can access the private EDB Cloud cluster. 

!!! Note
    EDB strongly discourages users from provisioning additional resources in the EDB Cloud resource virtual network.

You can connect to the private EDB Cloud cluster either from an application in Azure 
or from an on-premise network. The following sections contain walkthroughs to guide you through each of the options:

- [Connecting from Azure](01_connecting_from_azure)
- [Connecting from an On-Premise Network](02_connect_on_premises)

### Connection Examples

For the scenarios used in the examples walking you through connecting using the various options, assume that your EDB Cloud cluster is on a subscription called `development` and is being accessed from a VM on another subscription `test`.

To walk through an example in your own environment, you need: 
 - Your EDB Cloud cluster URL. You can find the URL in the **Connect** tab of your cluster instance in the EDB Cloud portal.
 -  IP address of your EDB Cloud cluster. For example:
   ```
  $ dig +short p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg.brcxzr08qr7rbei1.edbcloud.io 
  10.240.1.218
 ```
 -  A Linux VM called `vm-client` on subscription `test` with the following properties:
    -   Subscription: `test`
    -   resource group: `rg-client`
    -   virtual network: `vnet-client`
    -   virtual network subnet: `snet-client`
 - [psql Postgresql client](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed on your VM.
