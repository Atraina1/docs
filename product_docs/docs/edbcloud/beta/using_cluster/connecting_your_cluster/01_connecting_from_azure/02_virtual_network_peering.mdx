title: Virtual Network Peering Example
---

These are the steps to connect using Virtual Network Peering. To walk you through this example in your own environment, see the prerequisites described in [Connection Walkthrough Examples](../../connecting_your_cluster/#connection-walkthrough-examples).

#### Step 1: Create a virtual network peering link

You need to add two peerings links from both the VM VNet `vnet-client` side
and your EDB Cloud VNet `vnet-japaneast` side. One approach is to add the links from the VM's VNet `vnet-client` side,
in the **Peerings** page of the Virtual Network portal.

1. Add two peering links called `peer-client-edb` and `peer-edb-client`,
to join the address space of two virtual networks
together. To simplify the process, Azure creates both peering links for you when you add peering from
either side.

#### Step 2: Access EDB Cloud cluster PG service directly

Access the EDB Cloud cluster PG with its domain name from your cluster's
connection string. It is accessible from `vnet-client` after peering.
