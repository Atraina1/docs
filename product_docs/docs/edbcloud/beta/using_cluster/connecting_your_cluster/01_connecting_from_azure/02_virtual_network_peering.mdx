title: Virtual Network Peering Example
---

These are the steps to connect using Virtual Network Peering. To walk you through this example in your own environment, see the prerequisites described in [Connection Examples](../01_connecting_from_azure/#connection-examples).

#### Step 1: Create virtual network peering

You need to add two peerings links from both VM VNet `vnet-client` side
and your EDB Cloud VNet `vnet-japaneast` side. For example, you can do it from the VM's VNet `vnet-client` side,
in the "Peerings" page of the Virtual Network portal.

1. Add two peering links called `peer-client-edb` and `peer-edb-client`,
they will join the address space of two virtual networks
together. To simplify the process, Azure creates both peering links for you when you add peering from
either side.

#### Step 2: Access EDB Cloud cluster PG service directly

Access the EDB Cloud cluster PG with its domain name from your cluster's
connection string. It is accessible from `vnet-client` after peering.
