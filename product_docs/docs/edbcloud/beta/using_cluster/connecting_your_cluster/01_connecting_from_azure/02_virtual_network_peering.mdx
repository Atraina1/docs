title: Virtual Network Peering Example
---

These are the steps to connect using Virtual Network Peering. To walk through this example in you own environment, see the prerequisites described in [Connection Examples](../01_connecting_from_azure/#connection-examples).

#### Step 1: Create virtual network peering

You need to add two peerings links from both VM VNet "vnet-client" side
and your EDB Cloud VNet vnet-japaneast side, to simplify the process,
Azure will create both peering links for you when you add peering from
either side. For example, you can do it from VM VNet vnet-client side,
in the "Peerings" page of the Virtual Network portal.

We add two peering links called peer-client-edb and peer-edb-client,
they will join the address space of two virtual networks
together.

#### Step 2: Access EDB Cloud cluster PG service directly

Access the EDB Cloud cluster PG with its domain name from your cluster
connection string, it's accessible from "vnet-client" after peering.
