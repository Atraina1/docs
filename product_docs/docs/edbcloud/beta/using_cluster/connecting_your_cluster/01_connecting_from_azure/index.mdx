title: Connecting from Azure 
---

There are three different methods to connect to your cluster from Azure. Each method offers a different level of availability and security. The Azure Private Endpoint is the most commonly used method, however you can implement other solutions depending on your organization's requirements.

- [Azure Private Endpoint (Recommended)](#azure-private-endpoint-recommended)
- [Virtual Network Peering](#virtual-network-peering)
- [Azure VNet-VNet Connection](#azure-vnet-vnet-connection)


## Azure Private Endpoint (Recommended)

 Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that securely connects a private IP 
 address from your VNet to an external service. You only grant access to a single PG service instead of the entire EDB Cloud resource virtual network, thus ensuring maximum network isolation. For more information, see [Azure Private Endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview).

**Pros**
 - Service provider's and consumer's locations can be in different virtual networks and different subscriptions. 
 - Single set up can be shared with all consumers. 
 - No IP overlapping risk. 
 - Traffic passes securely through the Microsoft backbone network and not the internet.                                              
 - Most Azure homebrew services (such as CosmosDB) have built-in 
  [private link resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview#private-link-resource) that you can connect to via a private endpoint.

**Cons**
 - EDB Cloud virtual network can not initiate traffic to your application.
 - There is an associated cost. See [Azure Private Link pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/private-link/#pricing).

See [Private Endpoint Example](01_private_endpoint) for the steps for connecting using this method.

## Virtual Network Peering

Virtual network peering connects two Azure virtual networks. Once
peered, the virtual networks appear as one for connectivity purposes.
Traffic between virtual machines in the peered virtual networks is
routed through the Microsoft backbone infrastructure, through private IP
addresses and not the internet.

**Pros**
- Service provider's and consumer's virtual networks can be in different regions, subscriptions, or tenants. 
- Simple and easy to set up.
- Traffic passes securely through the Microsoft backbone network and not the internet.  
- The IP ranges of two peered virtual networks can not overlap. 

**Cons**
- There is an associated cost. See [pricing for virtual network peering](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-network/#pricing)  for details.   

See [Viritual Network Peering Example](02_virtual_network_peering) for the steps for connecting using this method.

## Azure VNet-VNet Connection

A VPN gateway is used to send encrypted traffic between Azure virtual networks. You can
connect your EDB Cloud virtual network and your client VM virtual network by using the VNet-to-VNet VPN gateway connection.

**Pros**
 - Traffic passes through an encrypted tunnel.
 - Service provider's and consumer's virtual networks can belong to different regions, subscriptions, or tenants. 
- All traffic is all through Microsoft backbone network, never going through the internet. 
- PG service domain name is accessible directly without a NAT. 
- VNets from different subscriptions do not need to be associated with the same Active Directory tenant.

**Cons**
- Limited bandwidth, see [virtual network gateway planning table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways#planningtable). 
- Set up is complicated. 
- There is an associated cost, see [virtual network gateway planning table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways#planningtable). 




 - Access to the Azure CLI and Azure portal.


See [VNet-VNet Example](03_vnet_vnet) for the steps for connecting using this method.
