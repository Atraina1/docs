title: Connecting from Azure 
---

There are three different methods to connect to your cluster from your Azure Virtual Network. Each method offers different levels of accessibility and security. The Azure Private Endpoint is the recommended and most commonly used method; however you can implement one of other solutions depending on your organization's requirements.

- [Azure Private Endpoint (Recommended)](#azure-private-endpoint-recommended)
- [Virtual Network Peering](#virtual-network-peering)
- [Azure VNet-VNet Connection](#azure-vnet-vnet-connection)

## Azure Private Endpoint (Recommended)

 Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that securely connects a private IP 
 address from your Azure Virtual Network (VNet) to an external service. You only grant access to a single PG service instead of the entire EDB Cloud resource virtual network, thus ensuring maximum network isolation. Private Endpoints are the same mechanism used by first-party Azure services such as CosmosDB for private VNet connectivity. For more information, see [Azure Private Endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview).

**Pros**
 - The Private Link only needs to be configured once, then multiple Private Links can be used to connect applications from many different VNets.
 - There is no risk of IP address conflicts.

**Cons**
 - Private Links (required by Private Endpoints) are not free. See [Azure Private Link pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/private-link/#pricing).

See the [Private Endpoint Example](01_private_endpoint) for the steps for connecting using this method.

## Virtual Network Peering

Virtual network peering connects two Azure Virtual Networks, allowing traffic to be freely routed between the two. Once peered, the two virtual networks act as one with respect to connectivity. Network Security Group rules are still observed.

**Pros**
- Simple and easy to set up.

**Cons**
- There is an associated cost. See [pricing for virtual network peering](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-network/#pricing) for details.
- The IP ranges of two peered virtual networks cannot overlap. EDB Cloud VNets use the 10.240.0.0/16 address space and cannot be peered with VNets utilizing this same space.

See the [Viritual Network Peering Example](02_virtual_network_peering) for the steps to connect using this VNet Peering.

## Azure VNet-VNet Connection

VNet-VNet connections use VPN gateways to send encrypted traffic between Azure virtual networks.

**Pros**
- PG service domain name is directly accessible without a NAT. 
- VNets from different subscriptions do not need to be associated with the same Active Directory tenant.

**Cons**
- Bandwidth is limited - see [virtual network gateway planning table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways#planningtable). 
- Configuration is complicated.
- There is an associated cost - see [virtual network gateway planning table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways#planningtable).

See the [VNet-VNet Example](03_vnet_vnet) for the steps for connecting using VNet-VNet Connection.



## Draft of alternative consolidated format for the Pros and Cons lists
REVIEWERS: MOIZ AND I WERE WORKING ON THIS ALTERNATIVE APPROACH FOR THE PROS AND CONS LISTS BUT IT IS STILL A WORK-IN-PROGRESS. WE DIDN'T WANT TO HOLD UP THE REVIEW WHEN WE WERE WORKING THROUGH WHETHER THIS FORMAT WOULD WORK. FOR EXAMPLE, IT STILL REQUIRES CONTENT CHANGES. WE ARE LEAVING IT IN FOR THIS REVIEW BUT WILL STICK WITH THE BULLETED LIST APPROACH IF WE AREN'T ABLE TO COMPLETE IT IN A TIMELY MANNER.
