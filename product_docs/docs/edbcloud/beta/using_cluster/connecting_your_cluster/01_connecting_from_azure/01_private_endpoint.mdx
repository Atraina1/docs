title: Private Endpoint Example
---

These are the steps to connect using Azure Private Endpoint. 

#### Prerequisites

Assume that your EDB Cloud cluster is on a subscription called `development` and is being accessed from a VM on another subscription `test`. To walk through an example in your own environment, you need: 
 - Your EDB Cloud cluster URL. You can find the URL in the **Connect** tab of your cluster instance in the EDB Cloud portal.
 -  IP address of your EDB Cloud cluster. For example:
   ```
  $ dig +short p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg.brcxzr08qr7rbei1.edbcloud.io 
  10.240.1.218
 ```
 -  A Linux VM called `vm-client` on subscription `test` with the following properties:
    -   Subscription: `test`
    -   resource group: `rg-client`
    -   virtual network: `vnet-client`
    -   virtual network subnet: `snet-client`
 - [psql Postgresql client](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed on your VM.

#### Step 1: Create an Azure Private Link Service tied to your EBD Cloud PG service
 
In the EDB Cloud cluster's virtual network, create an [Azure Private Link Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview)
in your EDB Cloud cluster resource group:

  1. Get the resource group details from the Azure CLI or the Azure portal and note down the resource group name. For example, if the EDB Cloud cluster's virtual network is `vnet-japaneast`, use the following command: 
 
     ```
       $ az network vnet list --query "[?name==\'vnet-japaneast\'].resourceGroup" -o json

     ```
  
  1. On the upper-left part of the page in the Azure portal, select **Create a resource**.
  
  1. Search for Private Link in the *Search the Marketplace* box.

  1. Click **Create**.

  1. Enter `pg-service-private-link` as the name for the Private Link Service and provide additional details as shown in the following screenshot. 
    
    ![Create private link service](../images/image5.png)

  1. Enter the resource group name obtained in step 1. 

  3. In the **Outbound settings** page, select the `kubernetes-internal` load balancer
    and select the IP address of your cluster in the **Load balancer frontend IP
    address**.

     ![Outbound settings](../images/image1.png)

  4. On the **Access security** page, configure the level of access for the private link service. You can choose to limit the exposure to subscriptions with Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) permissions, a restricted set of subscriptions, or all Azure subscriptions. See [control service exposure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview#control-service-exposure)
    for details.

  5. After the Private Link Service is created, note down its *alias*. The *alias*
   is the unique ID for your private service, which can be shared with the service consumers. Obtain the alias either from the Azure portal
   or by the using the following CLI command:

     ```
       $ az network private-link-service list --query "[?name=='pg-service-private-link'].alias" -o tsv
       pg-service-private-link.48f26b42-45dc-4e80-8e3d-307d58d7d274.japaneast.azure.privatelinkservice
     ```

  6. Select **Review + Create**.

  7. Select **Create**.

#### Step 2: Create an Azure Private Endpoint linking to the Private Link Service

  To connect to the PG service, create an Azure Private Endpoint in the application VM's virtual network. After you have created the private endpoint, you can use its private IP address to access the PG service.
  
  1. On the upper-left side of the screen in the portal, select **Create a resource > Networking > Private Link** or in the search box enter Private Link.
  
  1. Select **Create**.

  1. In Private Link Center, select **Private endpoints** in the left-hand menu.

  1. In Private endpoints, click **Create**.

  1. Enter "pg-service-private-link" as the name for the Private Link Service and provide additional details as shown in the following screenshot.

   ![](../images/image12.png)

  1. Connect the private endpoint to the EDB Cloud private link service that we created by entering its *alias*.

   ![](../images/image17.png)

  1. In the **Configuration** page, enter the VM's Virtual Network `vnet-client`.

  1. Select **Review + Create**.

  7. Select **Create**.
   
   !!! Note
      If the private endpoint's status appears as **Pending** for a long period, the private endpoint might not have the required permissions to access the `pg-service-private-link`. 
  
      Manually approve the connection request from the **Pending connections** page in **Private Link Center** using the Azure subscription for EDB Cloud.

      ![](../images/image3.png)


11. You have now successfully built a tunnel between your VM's virtual network and the EDB Cloud cluster network. You can access the private PG service by using the private endpoint:
   
   Get the private endpoint's private IP address using the following scripts:

 ```
  $ NICID=$(az network private-endpoint show -n pl-private-pg-service -g rg-client --query "networkInterfaces[0].id" -o tsv)
  $ az network nic show -n ${NICID##*/} -g rg-client --query "ipConfigurations[0].privateIpAddress" -o tsv
  100.64.111.5
 ``` 

12. From the VM `vm-client`, access the PG service by using the private IP address.

 ```
 $ psql -h 100.64.111.5 -0 edb_admin 
 
 Password for user edb_admin : 
 
 psql (13.4 (Ubuntu 13.4-1.pgdg20.04+1), server 13.4.8 (Debian 13.4.8-1+deb10)) 
 WARNING : psql major version 13, server major version 13. Some psql features might not work.

#### Step 3: Create an Azure Private DNS Zone for the Private Endpoint

EDB strongly recommends using an [Azure Private DNS Zone](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-privatednszone) with the Private Endpoint to establish a connection with the PG service. This is important for security purposes; it's not possible to validate TLS certificates (i.e., using `verify-full`) when specifying an IP address to connect to. This is achieved using something akin to a "split horizon" DNS configuration: we'll configure a DNS entry for your cluster's public hostname, and Azure DNS will ensure that all requests to that domain name from your VNet resolve to the private endpoint's IP address instead of the cluster's "normal" IP address.

1. In the Azure portal search bar, enter "Private DNS Zones" in the search text box and press Enter.
 
1. Click **Private DNS zone**.

1. Click **Create private DNS zone**.

1. Create a private DNS zone using your organization-level domain name as an apex domain, `brcxzr08qr7rbei1.edbcloud.io`.
 
 ![](../images/image6.png)

1. Select the **Virtual network** link on the **Private DNS Zone** page of `brcxzr08qr7rbei1.edbcloud.io` and link the private DNS Zone to the VM's virtual network
`vnet-client`.

 ![](../images/image10.png)

1. Add a new record for the private endpoint. The address is a private IP address - the one created with the Private Endpoint in the previous step.

 ![](../images/image4.png)

1. You can now access your PG service with this private domain name.

 ```
 $ dig +short p-c4iabjleig4@jngmac48. bxcxztÃ©sqr7rbeil.enterprisedb.network 
 10.240.1.123 
       
 $ psql -h p-c41a6jleig4@jngmac48.brcxzreaqr7rbeil.enterprisedb.network -u edh_admin      
 Password for user edb_admin: 
 
 psql (13.4 (Ubuntu 13.4-1.pgdg28.84+1), server 13.4.8 (Debian 13.4.8-1+deb10)) 
 WARNING : psql major version 13, server major version 13. Some psql features might not work. 
 SSL connection (protocol : TLSV1.3cipherTLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits : 256, compression : off) Type "help" for help.

 ```

 !!! Tip
    You might need to flush your local DNS cache, to resolve your domain name to the new private IP address after adding the private endpoint. For example, on Ubuntu run the following command:

  ```
  $ sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
  ```
