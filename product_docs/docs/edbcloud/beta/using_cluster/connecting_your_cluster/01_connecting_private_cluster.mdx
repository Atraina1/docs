title: Connecting from Azure 
---

There are three different methods to connect to your cluster from Azure. Each method offers a different level of availability and security. The Azure Private Endpoint is the most commonly used method, however you can implement other solutions depending on your organization's requirements.

- [Azure Private Endpoint (Recommended)](#azure-private-endpoint-recommended)
- [Virtual Network Peering](#virtual-network-peering)
- [Azure VNet-VNet Connection](#azure-vnet-vnet-connection)


## Azure Private Endpoint (Recommended)

 Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that securely connects a private IP 
 address from your VNet to an external service. You only grant access to a single PG service instead of the entire EDB Cloud resource virtual network, thus ensuring maximum network isolation. For more information, see [Azure Private Endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview).

**Pros**
 - Service provider's and consumer's locations can be in different virtual networks and different subscriptions. 
 - Single set up can be shared with all consumers. 
 - No IP overlapping risk. 
 - Traffic passes securely through the Microsoft backbone network and not the internet.                                              
 - Most Azure homebrew services (such as CosmosDB) have built-in 
  [private link resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview#private-link-resource) that you can connect to via a private endpoint.

**Cons**
 - EDB Cloud virtual network can not initiate traffic to your application.
 - There is an associated cost. See [Azure Private Link pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/private-link/#pricing).

See the [Azure Private Endpoint example](#azure-private-endpoint-example) for the steps for connecting using this method.

## Virtual Network Peering

Virtual network peering connects two Azure virtual networks. Once
peered, the virtual networks appear as one for connectivity purposes.
Traffic between virtual machines in the peered virtual networks is
routed through the Microsoft backbone infrastructure, through private IP
addresses and not the internet.

**Pros**
- Service provider's and consumer's virtual networks can be in different regions, subscriptions, or tenants. 
- Simple and easy to set up.
- Traffic passes securely through the Microsoft backbone network and not the internet.  
- The IP ranges of two peered virtual networks can not overlap. 

**Cons**
- There is an associated cost. See [pricing for virtual network peering](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-network/#pricing)  for details.                                                      

## Azure VNet-VNet Connection

A VPN gateway is used to send encrypted traffic between Azure virtual networks. You can
connect your EDB Cloud virtual network and your client VM virtual network by using the VNet-to-VNet VPN gateway connection.

**Pros**
 - Traffic passes through an encrypted tunnel.
 - Service provider's and consumer's virtual networks can belong to different regions, subscriptions, or tenants. 
- All traffic is all through Microsoft backbone network, never going through the internet. 
- PG service domain name is accessible directly without a NAT. 
- VNets from different subscriptions do not need to be associated with the same Active Directory tenant.

**Cons**
- Limited bandwidth, see [virtual network gateway planning table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways#planningtable). 
- Set up is complicated. 
- There is an associated cost, see [virtual network gateway planning table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways#planningtable). 



## Examples

This section contains walkthroughs to guide you through each of the connection methods. For the examples used in the walkthroughs, assume that your EDB Cloud cluster is on a subscription called `development` and is being accessed from a VM on another subscription `test`.

To walk through an example in your own environment, you need: 
 - Your EDB Cloud cluster URL. You can find the URL in the **Connect** tab of your cluster instance in the EDB Cloud portal.
 -  IP address of your EDB Cloud cluster. For example:
   ```
  $ dig +short p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg.brcxzr08qr7rbei1.edbcloud.io 
  10.240.1.218
 ```
 -  A Linux VM called `vm-client` on subscription `test` with the following properties:
    -   Subscription: `test`
    -   resource group: `rg-client`
    -   virtual network: `vnet-client`
    -   virtual network subnet: `snet-client`
 - [psql Postgresql client](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed on your VM.
 - Access to the Azure CLI and Azure portal.

### Azure Private Endpoint Example
These are the steps to connect using Azure Private Endpoint. To walk through this example in you own environment, see the prerequisites described in [Walkthroughs](#walkthroughs).

#### Step 1: Create an Azure Private Link Service tied to your EBD Cloud PG service
 
  In the EDB Cloud cluster's virtual network, 
  create an [Azure Private Link Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview) in your EDB Cloud cluster resource group. 

  1. Obtain the resource group details with a CLI command or from the Azure portal and note down the resource group name. For example, if the EDB Cloud cluster's virtual network is `vnet-japaneast`, use the following command: 
 
     ```
       $ az network vnet list --query
      "[?name==\'vnet-japaneast\'].resourceGroup" -o json

     ```
  
  1. On the upper-left part of the page in the Azure portal, select **Create a resource**.
  
  1. Search for Private Link in the Search the Marketplace box.

  1. Select **Create**.

  1. Enter `pg-service-private-link` as the name for the Private Link Service and provide additional details as shown in the following screenshot. 
    
    ![](images/image5.png)

  3. In the **Outbound settings** page, select the `kubernetes-inernal` load balancer,
    and select the IP address of your cluster from **Load balancer frontend IP
    address**.

     ![](images/image1.png)

  4. On the **Access security** page, configure the level of access for the private link service.

     ![](images/image21.png) 
   
   !!! Note
      Depending on the visibility level you set, the client application might need to request access
    permission from the EDB Cloud tenant to access this private link
    service. See [control service exposure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview#control-service-exposure)
    for details.
    

  5. After the Private Link Service is created, note down its `alias`. The `alias`
   is the unique ID for your private service that can be shared offline with any of
   the service consumers. Obtain the 'alias' either from the Azure portal
   or by the using the following CLI command:

     ```
       $ az network private-link-service list --query 
      "[?name=='pg-service-private-link'].alias" -o tsv
      pg-service-private-link.48f26b42-45dc-4e80-8e3d-307d58d7d274.japaneast.azure.privatelinkservice
     
     ```
  6. Select **Review + Create**.

  7. Select **Create**.

#### Step 2: Create an Azure Private Endpoint linking to the Private Link Service

  To connect to the PG service create an Azure Private Endpoint in your VM's virtual network. After you have created the private endpoint, you can use its private IP address to access the PG service.
  
  1. On the upper-left side of the screen in the portal, select **Create a resource > Networking > Private Link**, or in the search box enter Private Link.

  1. Select **Create**.

  1. In Private Link Center, select **Private endpoints** in the left-hand menu.

  1. In Private endpoints, select **+ Add**.

  1. Enter pg-service-private-link as the name for the Private Link Service and provide additional details as shown in the following screeshot.

   ![](images/image12.png)

  1. Connect the private endpoint to the EDB Cloud private link service we created by entering its alias.

   ![](images/image17.png)

  1. In the **Configuration** page, enter the VM's Virtual Network `vnet-client`.

  1. Select **Review + Create**.

  7. Select **Create**.
   
  8. You might have to approve the connection request from the `pg-service-private-link` owner, if the private endpoint is in the **Pending** status. 
   
   Switch to the EDB Cloud subscription and from the **Pending connections** page in **Private Link Center** and approve the connection request.

   ![](images/image3.png)


11. Now that you have successfully built a tunnel between your VM's virtual network and the EDB Cloud cluster network, access the private PG service by using the private endpoint.
   
   Get the private endpoint's private IP address with following scripts.

 ```
  $ NICID=$(az network private-endpoint show -n pl-private-pg-service
  -g rg-client --query "networkInterfaces[0].id" -o tsv)
  $ az network nic show -n ${NICID##*/} -g rg-client --query
  "ipConfigurations[0].privateIpAddress" -o tsv
  100.64.111.5
 ``` 

12. From the VM `vm-client`, access the PG service by using the private IP address.

 ![](images/image20.png)

#### Step 3: Create Azure Private DNS Zone for Private Endpoint

We recommend using an [Azure Private DNS Zone](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-privatednszone) with the Private Endpoint to establish a secure connection with the PG service. Create a Private DNS Zone manually with the following steps.

We will create a private domain name in an identical name to EDB Cloud PG
service's default domain name, i.e.
`p-c4ia6jleig40jngmac40.brcxzr08qr7rbei1.edbcloud.io`. This allows your
application to access the service in a consistent way from every place.
Azure's DNS resolving mechanism will ensure all access to this domain
name from `vnet-client` are resolved to private IP address of Private
Endpoint `pl-private-pg-service` instead of the original PG service's IP
address.

First, create a private DNS zone using the organization level domain
name as apex domain, `Brcxzr08qr7rbei1.edbcloud.io`.

![](images/image6.png)

Then you need to link this private DNS Zone to VM virtual network
`vnet-client`, this is done through the **Virtual network** link on the
**Private DNS Zone** page of `brcxzr08qr7rbei1.edbcloud.io`.

![](images/image10.png)

Then add a new record for the private endpoint, the address is a
private IP address associated with the private endpoint's NIC.

![](images/image4.png)

Wait for a few second to let DNS setting fully propagate, then you can
start access your PG service with this private domain name.

![](images/image20.png)

Sometimes, you may need to flush your local DNS cache, to resolve your
domain name to new private IP after adding the private endpoint. E.g. on
Ubuntu you can do this by:

```
  $ sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
```


### Azure Virtual Network Peering Example

#### Step 1: Create virtual network peering

You need to add two peerings links from both VM VNet "vnet-client" side
and your EDB Cloud VNet vnet-japaneast side, to simplify the process,
Azure will create both peering links for you when you add peering from
either side. For example, you can do it from VM VNet vnet-client side,
in the "Peerings" page of the Virtual Network portal.

We add two peering links called peer-client-edb and peer-edb-client,
they will join the address space of two virtual networks
together.

![](images/image25.png)

![](images/image7.png)

#### Step 2: Access EDB Cloud cluster PG service directly

Access the EDB Cloud cluster PG with its domain name from your cluster
connection string, it's accessible from "vnet-client" after peering.

![](images/image20.png)


### Azure VNet-VNet Connection Example

The Azure resources you need to create in this method include:

-   [Azure VPN Gateways](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways), one in each connected virtual network. See [Connect Using Azure VPN Gateway Point to Site](#connect-using-azure-vpn-gateway-point-to-site) for details about creating a virtual network gateway. 

!!! Tip (Tip)
    A VPN gateway creation can take up to 45 mins. 

#### Step 1: Create a VPN Gateway for the EDB Cloud cluster virtual network.

 In the "Virtual network gateway" page, create the first VPN gateway for the EDB Cloud Cluster resource virtual network 'vnet-japaneast'. Name the VPN gateway as `vpng-edbcloud`.

 ![](images/image8.png)

 !!! Note
    The VPN gateway automatically creates a dedicated subnet to accommodate its gateway VMs. Ensure that your EDB Cloud virtual network address space has sufficient IP range for the subnet to prevent errors in the virtual network.

#### Step 2: Create a VPN Gateway for the client VM virtual network

In the same way, create the second gateway for your client VM virtual network 'vnet-client'. Name the client VPN gateway as 'vpng-client'.

#### Step 3: Add a gateway connection between the two VPN gateways

Add a VPN gateway connection from `vpng-edbcloud`. Azure portal only supports creating gateway connections
between gateways in the same subscription. Use Azure CLI (or [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-vnet-vnet-rm-ps)) as follows:

1. Get the VPN gateway ID of `vpng-client`.

 -   In the EDB Cloud subscription:

    ```
   $ az network vnet-gateway show -n vpng-edbcloud -g
   brCxzr08qr7RBEi1-rg-japaneast-management --query "[id]" -otsv
   subscriptions\.../vpng-edbcloud
   ```

 -   In the VM's subscription:

   ```
   $ az network vnet-gateway show -n vpng-client -g rg-client --query "[id]" -o tsv
   /subscriptions/.../vpng-client
   ```

2. In the EDB Cloud subscription, create a connection from `vpng-edbcloud` to `vpng-client`.

  ```
  $ az network vpn-connection create -n vpnc-edbcloud-client -g
  brCxzr08qr7RBEi1-rg-japaneast-management --vnet-gateway1
  /subscriptions/.../vpng-edbcloud -l japaneast --shared-key
  "a_very_long_and_complex_psk" \--vnet-gateway2
  /subscriptions/.../vpng-client

  ```

 Note down '\--shared-key'. It is a PSK for pairing authentication from both sides, which is needed in the next step.

3. In the VM's subscription, create another connection from `vpng-client` to `vpng-ebdcloud`.

    ```
    $ az network vpn-connection create -n vpnc-client-edbcloud -g
   rg-client --vnet-gateway1 /subscriptions/.../vpng-client -l japaneast
   --shared-key "a_very_long_and_complex_psk!" --vnet-gateway2
   /subscriptions/.../vpng-edbcloud

    ```

#### Step 4: Verify the connection

1. After a few minutes, verify the gateway connection status either from either virtual networks with the following command:

 ```
   $ az network vpn-connection show --name vpnc-client-edbcloud -g rg-client --query "[connectionStatus]" -o tsv
   Connected
 ```

2. Verify the PG service connectivity.
