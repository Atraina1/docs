Before installing the EDB JDBC Connector, you must have Java installed on your system. You can download a Java installer that matches your environment from the Oracle Java Downloads [website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). Documentation that contains detailed installation instructions is available through the associated `Installation Instruction` links on the same page.

You can use the EDB Postgres Advanced Server graphical installer or an RPM package to add the EDB JDBC Connector to your installation.
