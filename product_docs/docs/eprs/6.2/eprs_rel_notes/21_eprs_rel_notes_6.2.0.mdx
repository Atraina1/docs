New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in EDB Postgres Replication Server 6.2.00 include the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Feature |  Registering your xDB Replication Server product with an EnterpriseDB product license key is no longer required.                  |
| Feature | Partitioned tables created using the declarative partitioning feature of PostgreSQL and Advanced Server version 10 and later can now be replicated in a log-based single-master or multi-master replication system. For more information, see [Replicating Postgres Partitioned Tables](../07_common_operations/10_replicating_postgres_partitioned_tables/#replicating_postgres_partitioned_tables). |
| Feature | In a single-master replication system, removal of a table from a publication that has one or more existing subscriptions is now permitted as long as the table to be removed is not the parent referenced in a foreign key constraint from a child table that is not being removed as well. Previously, no tables from a publication in a single-master replication system could be removed if there are existing subscriptions. For more information, see [Removing Tables from a Publication](../07_common_operations/06_managing_publication/03_updating_pub/#remove_tables_from_pub). |
