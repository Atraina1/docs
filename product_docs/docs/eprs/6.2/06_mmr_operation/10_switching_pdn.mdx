After the multi-master replication system is created, you can switch the role of the primary definition node with another primary node.

**Step 1:** Make sure the publication server whose node is the parent of the primary nodes of the replication system is running and has been registered in the xDB Replication Console you are using. See Section [Registering a Publication Server](../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) for directions on starting and registering a publication server.

**Step 2:** Select the Publication Database node corresponding to the primary node that you wish to set as the primary definition node.


**Step 3:** Click the secondary mouse button on the Publication Database node and choose `Set as MDN`.


**Step 4:** In the `Set as MDN` confirmation box, click the `Yes` button.


**Step 5:** The selected master node is now the master definition node.


**Step 6:** The value `Yes` in the MDN field of the Property window indicates this database is the primary definition node.

The new primary definition node is moved to the top of the replication tree in the xDB Replication Console.

You should now perform a synchronization replication to ensure that the new primary definition node is synchronized with the other primary nodes. See [Performing Synchronization Replication](05_on_demand_replication_mmr/#perform_synchronization_replication_mmr) for directions on performing a synchronization replication.
