title: Upgrading

To upgrade to a new minor release:

1. Stop the service for the currently installed version.
2. Install the new release. See [Installing](01_installation) for more information.
3. If you have any custom configurations in the `edb-pgbouncer.ini` and `userlist.txt` files for the previously installed version, copy them from the versions of those files where the customization were made and paste them to the corresponding files for the release you just installed.

You can upgrade to a patch release with a simple in place upgrade.
