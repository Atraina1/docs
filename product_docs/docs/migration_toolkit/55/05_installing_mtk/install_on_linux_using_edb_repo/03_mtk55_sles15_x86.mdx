There are three steps to completing an installation:

- [Setting up the repository](#setting-up-the-repository)
- [Installing the package](#installing-the-package)
- [Installing source-specific drivers](/05_installing_mtk/#installing-source-specific-drivers)

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

Before setting up the repository, you need to register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

## Setting up the repository

```shell
# Install the repository configuration
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# Register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
# Replace 'REGISTRATION_CODE' and 'EMAIL' with your SUSE registration information
SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.3/x86_64

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh

# Install OpenJDK (version 11) for Java based components
zypper -n install java-11-openjdk
```

## Installing the package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-migrationtoolkit
```
