To install Migration Toolkit, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials that allow you to access an EnterpriseDB repository, see the [EDB Repository Access instructions](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

## RHEL 8/OL 8

You can use an RPM package to install Migration Toolkit on a RHEL 8/OL host. The following steps provide detailed information about accessing the EnterpriseDB repository and installing Migration Toolkit.

### Creating a Repository Configuration File

1.  To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command

    ```text
    dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/
    edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

    The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

2.  After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to ensure that the value of the `enabled` parameter is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

    ```text
    [edb]
    name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
    baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/
    edb/
    redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
    ```

3.  After saving your changes to the configuration file, install the EPEL repository:

    ```text
    dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/
    epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
    ```

4.  Enable the codeready-builder repository to resolve dependencies:

    ```text
    ARCH=$( /bin/arch )
    subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for
    -rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"
    ```

### Installing Migration Toolkit

```text
dnf -y install edb-migrationtoolkit
```

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter a `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

After installing Migration Toolkit, you must configure the installation. Perform the following steps before invoking Migration Toolkit.

### Using Migration Toolkit with IDENT authentication

By default, the `pg_hba.conf` file for the RPM installer enforces `IDENT` authentication for remote clients. Before invoking Migration Toolkit, you must either modify the `pg_hba.conf` file, changing the authentication method to a form other than `IDENT` (and restarting the server), or perform the following steps to ensure that an `IDENT` server is accessible:

1.  Confirm that an `identd` server is installed and running. You can use the yum package manager to install an `identd` server by invoking the command:

       `yum install xinetd authd`

       The command should create a file named `/etc/xinetd.d/auth` that contains:

    ```text
    service auth
    {
    disable       = yes
    socket_type   = stream
    wait          = no
    user          = ident
    cps           = 4096 10
    instances     = UNLIMITED
    server        = /usr/sbin/in.authd
    server_args   = -t60 --xerror --os
    }
    ```

    !!! Note
        If the file includes a `-E` argument at the end of `server_args`, please erase the `-E`.

    Then, to start the `identd` server, invoke the commands:

    ```text
    systemctl enable xinetd
    systemctl start xinetd
    ```

2.  Open the `pg_ident.conf` file and create a user mapping:

    ```text
    # map_name system_username postgres_username
    edbas enterprisedb enterprisedb
    ```

    Where:

    -   The name specified in the `map_name` column is a user-defined name that will identify the mapping in the pg_hba.conf file.
    -   The name specified in the `system_username` column is enterprisedb.
    -   The name specified in the `postgres_username` column is enterprisedb.

3.  Open the `pg_hba.conf` file and modify the `IDENT` entries.

    On an IPv4 host:

    `host all all 127.0.0.0/0 ident map=edbas`

    On an IPv6 host:

    `host all all ::1/128 ident map=edbas`

4.  Restart the EDB Postgres Advanced Server service before invoking Migration Toolkit.

## SLES 15 

There are three steps to completing an installation:

- [Setting up the repository](#setting-up-the-repository)
- [Installing the package](#installing-the-package)
- [Installing source-specific drivers](../../05_installing_mtk/#installing-source-specific-drivers)

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

Before setting up the repository, you need to register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

### Setting up the repository

Setting up the repository is a one time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform these steps.

```shell
# Install the repository configuration and enter your EDB repository 
# credentials when prompted
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to 
# SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# Register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
# Replace 'REGISTRATION_CODE' and 'EMAIL' with your SUSE registration 
# information
SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'

# Activate the required SUSE module
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.3/x86_64

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh
```

### Installing the package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-migrationtoolkit
```
## SLES 12

<div id="sles_installation" class="registered_link"></div>

You can use the zypper package manager to install a Migration toolkit on an SLES 12 host. `zypper` attempts to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to specific repositories that are not hosted at EnterpriseDB.

1.  You must assume superuser privileges and stop any firewalls before installing Migration Toolkit. Then, use the following commands to add EnterpriseDB repositories to your system:

    ```text
    zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/
    edb-sles.repo
    ```

2.  The command creates the repository configuration files in the /etc/zypp/repos.d directory. Use the following command to refresh the metadata on your SLES host to include the EnterpriseDB repository:

    ```text
    zypper refresh
    ```

    When prompted, provide credentials for the repository; specify `a` to always trust the provided key and update the metadata to include the EnterpriseDB repository.

3.  You must also add SUSEConnect and the SUSE Package Hub extension to the SLES host, and register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories. Use the commands:

    ```text
    SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'

    SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/x86_64

    SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/x86_64
    ```

4.  Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories:

    ```text
    zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/
    Apache:/Modules/SLE_12_SP4/Apache:Modules.repo
    ```

5.  Use the following command to refresh the metadata:

    ```text
    zypper refresh
    ```

6.  Install OpenJDK (version 1.8) for Java based components:

    ```text
    zypper -n install java-1_8_0-openjdk
    ```

7.  Now you can use the zypper utility to install a Migration Toolkit:

    ```text
    zypper -n install edb-migrationtoolkit
    ```
