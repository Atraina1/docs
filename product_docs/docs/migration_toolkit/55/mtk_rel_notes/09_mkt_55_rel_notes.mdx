New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Migration Toolkit 55.0.0 include:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| New Feature | Support for parallel data loading at the table level. This allows you to use multiple threads to load data in parallel from the source database table and apply in parallel on the target database table. This significantly improves the data load time when dealing with relatively large size tables. The lab benchmark results have revealed a 25-60% reduction in the data load duration for a large table when using multiple parallel threads. This feature is supported for source PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Advanced Server, and Oracle databases. See [Migration Options for Parallel Data Loading](http://localhost:8000/migration_toolkit/latest/08_mtk_command_options/#migration-options-for-parallel-data-loading). |
| Enhancement | As part of the table-level parallel data loading enhancement, the `tableLoaderLimit` and `parallelLoadRowLimit` options have been added to the command-line options list.
| Enhancement | Support of schema and data migration from Oracle versions 18c and 19c. |
| Enhancement | Total migration time for the the schema and data migration session is reported via the `Total Elapsed Migration Time` attribute. |
