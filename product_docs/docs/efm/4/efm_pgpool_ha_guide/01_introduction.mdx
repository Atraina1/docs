Failover Manager is a high-availability module that monitors the health
of a Postgres streaming replication cluster and verifies failures
quickly. When a database failure occurs, Failover Manager can
automatically promote a streaming replication standby node into a
writable primary node. This capability ensures continued performance and protects
against data loss with minimal service interruption.

A Failover Manager cluster is made up of Failover Manager processes
that reside on the following hosts on a network:

-   A primary node is the primary database server that is servicing
    database clients.

-   One or more standby nodes are streaming replication servers
    associated with the primary node.

-   The witness node confirms assertions of either the primary or a
    standby in a failover scenario. If, during a failure situation, the
    primary is in a partition with half or more of the nodes,
    it stays primary. As such, Failover Manager supports running in
    a cluster with an even number of agents.
