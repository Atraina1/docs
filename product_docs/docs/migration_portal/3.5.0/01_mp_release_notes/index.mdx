The Migration Portal documentation describes the latest version of Migration Portal.

New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Migration Portal 3.5.1 include the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Enhancement | Added a validation to prevent the use of DDL files generated by the DDL Extractor previously provided by EDB.  The current version of the migration portal requires the DDL that is assessed by the Migration Portal to be generated using the Oracle `EXPDP` and `IMPDP` Data Pump utilities according to the [Performing a schema extraction](../04_mp_migrating_database/01_mp_schema_extraction) instructions. Note that disabling the use of DDL extractor generated files is expected to be a temporary measure for this release until issues that were encountered after the 3.5.0 release are fully addressed. |
| Security Fix | Migration Portal uses the EDB JDBC driver for communicating with the underlying database. The driver has been updated to version 42.3.2.1, which covers recent security fixes. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed different parsing related errors encountered after the 3.5.0 release. |
