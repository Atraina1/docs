You can perform a schema extraction using either of the following methods. EDB recommends using the EDB DDL extractor to extract your schemas.
 -  [EDB DDL extractor](#extracting-schemas-using-the-edb-ddl-extractor) (recommended method)
 -  [Oracle’s Data Pump utility](01_data_pump_utility/) 

## Extracting schemas using the EDB DDL Extractor

Download the latest EDB DDL Extractor script from the Migration Portal `Projects` page.

!!! Note
    Migration Portal might become unresponsive for very large SQL files, depending on your system’s and browser’s resource availability. To resolve this, try extracting fewer schemas at a time to reduce the SQL file size.

#### Prerequisites

 The EDB DDL Extractor script can be run in SQL Developer or SQL\*Plus. It uses Oracle’s `DBMS_METADATA` built-in package to extract DDLs for different objects under schemas (specified while running the script). The EDB DDL extractor creates the DDL file uploaded to the portal and analyzed for EDB Postgres compatibility.

 
!!! Note
    You must have `CONNECT` and `SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE` roles and `CREATE TABLE` privilege.

**For SQL\*Plus**

1.  Connect to SQL\*Plus and run the command:

    `SQL>@edb_ddl_extractor.sql`

2.  When prompted, if the Oracle user that is running the script has the required privileges, select the `Enter` key to continue running the script. 

3.  When prompted, provide the schema name. When extracting multiple schemas, use a comma (`‘,’`) as a delimiter.

 !!! Note
     If you want to extract all the user schemas from the current database, do not mention any schema names while extracting. However, it is recommended to mention the schema names that you would like to extract.

4.  When prompted, enter the path or directory in which the extractor will store the extracted DDL.  If no path is specified, the extracted DDL will be output to the  directory from which the SQL\*Plus command was run.
  
5.  When prompted, enter `yes`or `no` depending on whether you want to extract dependent objects from other schemas.

**For example, on Linux:**

```text
Enter a comma separated list of schemas to be extracted (Default all schemas): HR, SCOTT, FINANCE

Location for output file (Default current location) : /home/oracle/extracted_ddls/

WARNING:

Given schema(s) list may contain objects which are dependent on objects from other schema(s), not mentioned in the list.` `Assessment may fail for such objects. It is suggested to extract all dependent objects together.

Extract dependent object from other schemas?(yes/no) (Default no / Ignored for all schemas option): yes
```
**On Windows:**

```text
Enter comma separated list of schemas to be extracted (Default all schemas): HR, SCOTT, FINANCE

Location for output file (Default current location) : c:\Users\Example\Desktop\

WARNING:

Given schema(s) list may contain objects which are dependent on objects from other schema(s), not mentioned in the list.` `Assessment may fail for such objects. It is suggested to extract all dependent objects together.

Extract dependent object from other schemas?(yes/no) (Default no / Ignored for all schemas option): yes
```

**For SQL Developer**

After loading the `edb_ddl_extractor.sql` script into SQL Developer and connecting to the source Oracle database, run the script.  As the script executes, respond to the prompts as they are displayed.

1.  If the the user for the database connection has the required privileges as listed in the Script Output tab, select the **Yes** button to continue running the script.

2.  Enter a comma-separated list of schemas and select the **OK** button to proceed.

3.  Enter the path for the output file and select the **OK** button to proceed.  
  
    *Note that if no value is entered, the output file will be generated in the same location as the DDL Extractor script.*

4.  Enter **yes** or **no** to extract dependant objects and select the **OK** button to proceed.  
  
    *If no value is provided, the script defaults to not extracting dependent objects.*

Output of the DDL Extractor run will be shown in the Script Output tab.  The name of the output file will be shown after the Extraction Completed message in the script output.

!!! Note
    You can also enter single schema name in both SQL\*Plus and SQL Developer.

The script then iterates through the object types in the source database and once the task is completed, the .SQL output is stored at the entered location (e.g., `c:\Users\Example\Desktop\`. 

See an important [note](#a-note-about-file-encoding) about the file encoding format expected by the Migration Portal.

**Additional Notes**

-   The EDB DDL Extractor script does not extract objects restored using `Flashback` and still have names like `BIN$b54+4XlEYwPgUAB/AQBWwA==$0`. If you want to extract these objects, you must change the name of the objects and re-run the extraction process.
-   The EDB DDL Extractor extracts `nologging` tables as normal tables. Once these tables are migrated to EDB Postgres Advanced Server, WAL log files will be created.
-   The EDB DDL Extractor only extracts objects with a VALID status.  Any objects that have an INVALID status that are desired to be assessed by the Migration Portal, first need to be updated to be VALID for them to be extracted by the EDB DDL extractor.
-   The EDB DDL Extractor does not extract objects that have been obfuscated using the Oracle wrap feature.  As such, these objects will not be included in the set of DDL assessed by the Migration Portal.  If it is desired that these objects be assessed and migrated to EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the wrapped versions of the objects will need to be replaced with non-wrapped versions.  See the [Wrappped Objects](#wrapped-objects) note below for more information.
-   The EDB DDL Extractor creates Global Temporary tables to store the schema names and their dependency information. These tables are dropped at the end of successful extraction.
-   The EDB DDL Extractor script does not extract schemas whose name starts with `PG_` because PostgreSQL does not support it. If you want to extract these schemas, you must change name of schema before extraction.

## Wrapped objects  

The Migration Portal is not able to assess wrapped objects.  As such, if they are included in the extracted DDL, they will not be loaded into the Migration Portal and not included in the count of objects that are assessed.  If wrapped objects are to be assessed and migrated to EDB Postgres Advanced server, the DDL file that is uploaded into the Migration Portal will need to include unwrapped versions of the objects.  The recommended way of doing this is to replace the wrapped versions in the Oracle database with clear text versions prior to performing the schema extraction. After performing the schema extraction, the objects can be replaced with the wrapped versions.

## A note about file encoding

Migration Portal recommends the .SQL output file be in the UTF-8 encoding format. If a .SQL file with a non UTF-8 encoding is uploaded, all the characters that are not compatible with UTF-8 are converted to the replacement character ‘�’ in the ouput DDL.

!!! Tip
    You can manually convert the extracted file to the UTF-8 format by using the *iconv* utility on Linux or the *LibIconv* utility on Windows. For example, if your database character set is in Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1), you can convert the extracted file to the UTF-8 format, as follows:
 
    `iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t UTF-8 sample.sql > sample_utf8.sql`
