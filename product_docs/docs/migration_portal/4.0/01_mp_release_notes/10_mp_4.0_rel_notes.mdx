New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Migration Portal 4.0 include the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Enhancement | The issues related to the DDL Extractor are resolved and the temporary restriction introduced on the use of DDL Extractor file format is removed.|
| Enhancement | The schema assessment algorithms are optimized to address a few performance related issues and to reduce overall schema assessment time.|
| Security Fix | The jackson-databind and h2 libraries are upgraded to the latest versions to address security issues (CVE-2020-36518, CVE-2022-23221, CVE-2021-42392 and CVE-2021-23463).|
| Bug Fix | Fixed the grammar rule to resolve a parsing error that skipped execution of a repair handler to remove EDITIONABLE keywords.|
| Bug Fix | Fixed the repair handler to perform proper conversion of Oracle PIPELINED and PIPE ROW function calls.|
| Bug Fix | The case sensitivity was lost when an object name was based on Unicode characters; this is now fixed.|
| Bug Fix | Fixed the issue that displays the Getting Started wizard when Migration Portal landing page is opened for the first time for a new user.|
| Bug Fix | The VIEW definition was truncated during transformation in the target EPAS DDL script; this issue is now fixed.|
| Bug Fix | Previously the files having the characters that were not compatible with UTF-8 were failing at the start of the Assessment phase. Migration Portal will now read the SQL files as UTF-8. The user should convert the SQL file to UTF-8 before uploading. In case a non UTF-8 file is uploaded, all the characters that are not compatible with UTF-8  will be converted to the replacement character ‘�’ and assessment will continue without failing.|
