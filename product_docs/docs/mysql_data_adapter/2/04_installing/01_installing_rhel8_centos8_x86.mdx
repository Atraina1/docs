## Possible Additional Actions Needed 

If yum asks for your permission to import the key to your local server, it means the package is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system. If you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source when prompted, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

If yum encounters a dependency that it cannot resolve, it provides a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.
