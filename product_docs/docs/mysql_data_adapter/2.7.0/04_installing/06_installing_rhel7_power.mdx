Use the following command to install the MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper:
  ```text
   sudo yum install edb-as<xx>-mysql5_fdw
   ```
where `<xx>` is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version number. 

!!! Note
    MySQL 8.0 RPMs are not available for the CentOS 7 ppc64le platform.



#### Troubleshooting the installation

If the package was not found, you may not have set up access to the repo. See [Setting up the Repository](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux/01_epas_using_edb_repository/edb-postgres-advanced-server_14_rhel-8-or-centos-8-or-ol-8_x86_64#setting-up-the-repository).

If yum asks for your permission to import the key to your local server, it means the package is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system. If you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source when prompted, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

If yum encounters a dependency that it cannot resolve, it provides a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.
