To install the MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper, use this command:

```text
sudo apt-get install edb-as<xx>-mysql<y>-fdw
```
where `<xx>` is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version number and `y` is the MySQL version (5 or 8).


#### Troubleshooting the installation

If the package was not found, you may not have set up access to the repo. See [Setting up the Repository](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux/01_epas_using_edb_repository/edb-postgres-advanced-server_14_rhel-8-or-centos-8-or-ol-8_x86_64#setting-up-the-repository).

If yum asks for your permission to import the key to your local server, it means the package is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system. If you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source when prompted, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

If yum encounters a dependency that it cannot resolve, it provides a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.
