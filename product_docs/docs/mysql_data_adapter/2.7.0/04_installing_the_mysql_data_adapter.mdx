<div id="using_an_rpm_package_to_install_the_data_adapter" class="registered_link"></div>

You can install the MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper on the following operating systems on Linux x86-64:

-   [RHEL 8/CentOS 8](#on-rhel-8centos-8)
-   [RHEL 7/CentOS 7](#on-rhel-7centos-7)
-   [Ubuntu/Debian](#on-ubuntudebian)

### On RHEL 8/CentOS 8


To install the MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper, use this command:

```text
sudo dnf install edb-as<xx>-mysql8_fdw
```
where `<xx>` is the EDB Postres Advanced Server version number.

#### Troubleshooting the installation

If the package was not found, you may not have set up access to the repo. See [Setting up the Repository](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux/01_epas_using_edb_repository/edb-postgres-advanced-server_14_rhel-8-or-centos-8-or-ol-8_x86_64#setting-up-the-repository).

If yum asks for your permission to import the key to your local server, it means the package is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system. If you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source when prompted, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

If yum encounters a dependency that it cannot resolve, it provides a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

### On RHEL 7/CentOS 7

These instructions assume you have already set up access to the EDB repository and installed EDB Postres Advanced Server. If you have not, see [Setting up the Repository]().


Use the following command to enable the appropriate subrepository and install the MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper:
 - For MySQL 8:
   ```text
   sudo yum -y install --enablerepo=mysql80-community --disablerepo=mysql57-community edb-as<xx>-mysql8_fdw
   ```
 - For MySQL 5: 
   ```text
   sudo yum -y install --enablerepo=mysql57-community --disablerepo=mysql80-community edb-as<xx>-mysql5_fdw
   ```
where `<xx>` is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version number. 

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.
