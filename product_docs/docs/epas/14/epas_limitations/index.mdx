The following limitations apply:

-   EDB recommends you don't store the `data` directory of a production database on an NFS file system. See the [19.2.2.1. NFS](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/creating-cluster.html#CREATING-CLUSTER-FILESYSTEM) section in the PostgreSQL documentation for more information.
-   The LLVM JIT package is supported on RHEL or CentOS x86 only.
