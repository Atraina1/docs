## Hardware Requirements

The following installation requirements assume you select the default options during the installation process. The minimum hardware requirements to install and run Advanced Server are:

-   1 GHz processor
-   2 GB of RAM
-   512 MB of HDD

Additional disk space is required for data or supporting components.

## Software Requirements

**User Privileges**

To perform an Advanced Server installation on a Linux system you must have superuser or administrator or sudo privileges.

To perform an Advanced Server installation on a Windows system you must have administrator privilege. If you are installing Advanced Server on a Windows system that is configured with `User Account Control` enabled, you can assume sufficient privileges to invoke the graphical installer by right clicking on the name of the installer and selecting `Run as administrator` from the context menu.

**Windows-specific Software Requirements**

Apply the Windows operating system updates before invoking the installer. If the installer encounters errors during the installation process, exit the installation and ensure that your Windows version is up-to-date before restarting the installer.
