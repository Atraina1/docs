title: "Using a Local Repository for CentOS or RHEL"
---

You can list the dependencies of a package by running the following command:

-   On Fedora | RHEL | CentOS: `repoquery --requires --resolve <package_name>`
-   On Debian | Ubuntu: `apt-cache depends <package_name>`

Where, `package_name` is the name of the package that you want to install.


The RPM installers place Advanced Server components in the directories listed in the table below:

### Advanced Server RPM Packages

The tables that follow list the RPM packages that are available from EDB. You can also use the `yum search` or `dnf search` command to access a list of the packages that are currently available from your configured repository. Open a command line, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

On RHEL or CentOS 7:

```text
yum search <package>
```

On RHEL or CentOS 8:

```text
dnf search <package>
```

Where `package` is the search term that specifies the name (or partial name) of a package.

Please note: The available package list is subject to change.

### Updating an RPM Installation

If you have an existing Advanced Server RPM installation, you can use `yum` or `dnf` to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the `edb.repo` file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum upgrade edb-repo
    ```

-   On RHEL or CentOS 8:

    ```text
    dnf upgrade edb-repo
    ```

`yum` or `dnf` will update the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use `yum` or `dnf` to upgrade all packages whose names include the expression `edb`:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum upgrade edb*
    ```

-   On RHEL or CentOS 8:

    ```text
    dnf upgrade edb*
    ```

!!! Note
    The `yum upgrade` or `dnf upgrade` command will only perform an update between minor releases; to update between major releases, you must use `pg_upgrade`.

For more information about using yum commands and options, enter `yum --help` on your command line.

## Creating an Advanced Server Repository on an Isolated Network

You can create a local repository to act as a host for the Advanced Server RPM packages if the server on which you wish to install Advanced Server (or supporting components) cannot directly access the EDB repository. Please note that this is a high-level listing of the steps requires; you will need to modify the process for your individual network.

To create and use a local repository, you must:

-   Use `yum` or `dnf` to install the `epel-release`, `yum-utils`, and `createrepo` packages.

    On RHEL or CentOS 7.x:

    ```bash
    yum install epel-release
    yum install yum-utils
    yum install createrepo
    ```

    On RHEL or CentOS 8.x:

    ```bash
    dnf install epel-release
    dnf install yum-utils
    dnf install createrepo
    ```

-   Create a directory in which to store the repository:

    ```text
    mkdir /srv/repos
    ```

-   Copy the RPM installation packages to your local repository. You can download the individual packages or use a tarball to populate the repository. The packages are available from the EDB repository at <https://repos.enterprisedb.com/>.

-   Sync the RPM packages and create the repository.

    ```text
    reposync -r edbas14 -p /srv/repos
    createrepo /srv/repos
    ```

-   Install your preferred webserver on the host that will act as your local repository, and ensure that the repository directory is accessible to the other servers on your network.

-   On each isolated database server, configure `yum` or `dnf` to pull updates from the mirrored repository on your local network. For example, you might create a repository configuration file called `/etc/yum.repos.d/edb-repo` with connection information that specifies:

    ```text
    [edbas14]
    name=EnterpriseDB Advanced Server 14
    baseurl=https://yum.your_domain.com/edbas14
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0
    ```

After specifying the location and connection information for your local repository, you can use `yum` or `dnf` commands to install Advanced Server and its supporting components on the isolated servers. For example:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as14-server
    ```

-   On RHEL or CentOS 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install edb-as14-server
    ```
