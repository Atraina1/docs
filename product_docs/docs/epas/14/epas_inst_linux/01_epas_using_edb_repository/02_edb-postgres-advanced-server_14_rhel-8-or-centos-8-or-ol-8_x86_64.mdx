You can set up the repository and install EDB Postgres Advanced Server and, optionally, other EDB products. To proceed, you must be logged in as superuser.

To log in as a superuser:

```sh
sudo su -
```

## Setting up the Repository

Perform this one-time setup to access the repository.

```sh

# To register with EDB to receive credentials for the EDB repository, go to https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request.

# Set up the EDB repository to create the `/etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo` configuration file:

dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm

# Add your EDB credentials to the edb.repo file by replacing USERNAME:PASSWORD with the username and password for your EDB account. See https://www.enterprisedb.com/user. 

sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo

# Install the EPEL repository and refresh the cache:

dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
dnf makecache

# The EPEL packages may depend on packages from other repositories. To download the packages, enable the repositories:

ARCH=$( /bin/arch )
subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"

# Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:

dnf -qy module disable postgresql   
```

## Installing the Package

To install other products at the same time add one or more additional product package names separated by a space. You can get a list of package names using the `dnf list available` command.

```sh
dnf -y install edb-as14-server 
```

Installing the EDB Postgres Advanced Server package creates an operating system user named enterprisedb. The user is assigned a user ID (UID) and a group ID (GID). The user has no default password. Use the `passwd` command to assign a password for the user. The default shell for the user is `bash` and the user's home directory is `/var/lib/edb/as14`.

## Initial Configuration
This section steps you through getting started with your cluster including logging in, ensuring the installation and initial configuration was successful, connecting to your cluster, and creating the user password. See [Managing Your Cluster > Connecting to Your Cluster](), for more information including how to use pgAdmin4 to connect to your cluster using its graphical interface instead of the command line option given below.

```text
# Initialize the database cluster:

PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="-E UTF-8" /usr/edb/as14/bin/edb-as-14-setup initdb
   
# Start the database cluster:

systemctl start edb-as-14


# Connecting to Your Database cluster

# To work in your cluster, login as `enterprisedb` user:

su - enterprisedb

# Connect to the database server using psql command line client:

psql edb

# Assign a password to the database superuser `enterprisedb`:

ALTER ROLE enterprisedb IDENTIFIED BY password;

# Creating a database (named hr):

CREATE DATABASE hr;

# Connect to the new database and create a table (named dept):

\c hr
CREATE TABLE public.dept (deptno numeric(2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT dept_pk PRIMARY KEY, 
dname varchar(14) CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE, loc varchar(13));


# Add data to the table:

INSERT INTO dept VALUES (10,'ACCOUNTING','NEW YORK');
INSERT into dept VALUES (20,'RESEARCH','DALLAS');

# You can use simple SQL commands to query the database and retrieve information about the data you have added to the table. 

SELECT * FROM dept;

```
