You can use the platform-specific package managers to install Advanced Server or Advanced Server supporting components. The platform-specific package managers attempt to satisfy package dependencies as they install a package, but requires access to the Advanced Server repositories. If your system does not have access to a repository via the Internet, you can use RPM to install a individual package or create a local repository for CentOS or RHEL, but you may be required to manually satisfy package dependencies.
