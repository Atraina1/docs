There are two steps to completing an installation:

-   Setting up the repository
-   Installing the package

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

To log in as a superuser:

```shell
sudo su -
```

## Setting up the repository

1. To register with EDB to receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

1. Set up the EDB repository:

   ```shell
   dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
   ```

   This creates the /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo configuration file.

1. Replace `'USERNAME:PASSWORD'` below with your username and password available from your
   [EDB account](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user) in the edb.repo file:

   ```shell
   sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
   ```

1. Install EPEL repository and refresh the cache:

   ```shell
   dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
   dnf makecache
   ```

1. Enable the codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-\*-rpms repository since EPEL packages may depend on packages from it:

   ```shell
   ARCH=$( /bin/arch )
   subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"
   ```

1. Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:
   ```shell
   dnf -qy module disable postgresql
   ```

## Installing the package

```shell
dnf -y install edb-as14-server
```

Installing the server package creates an operating system user named `enterprisedb`. The user is assigned a user ID (UID) and a group ID (GID). The user has no default password. Use the `passwd` command to assign a password for the user. The default shell for the user is `bash` and the user's home directory is `/var/lib/edb/as14`.

## Initial configuration

Creating a database cluster and starting the service:

To initialize a cluster with the non-default values, you can use the `PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS` environment variable by invoking the `edb-as-14-setup` cluster initialization script that resides under `EPAS_Home/bin`.

To invoke `initdb` export the `PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS` environment variable with the following command:

```text
PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="-E UTF-8" /usr/edb/as14/bin/edb-as-14-setup initdb
```

After creating the cluster, use `systemctl` to start, stop, or restart the service:

```text
systemctl { start | stop | restart } edb-as-14
```
