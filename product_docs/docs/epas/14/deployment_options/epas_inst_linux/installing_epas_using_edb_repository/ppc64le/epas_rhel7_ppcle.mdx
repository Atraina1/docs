You can use an RPM package to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on a RHEL 7 ppc64le host.

-   To install the Advance Toolchain repository:

    ```text
    rpm --import https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/toolchain/at/redhat/RHEL7/gpg-pubkey-6976a827-5164221b
    ```

    The repository configuration file is named `advance-toolchain.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d.`

-   After creating the `advance-toolchain.repo` file, the `enabled` parameter is set to `1` by default.

    ```text
    [advance-toolchain]
    name=Advance Toolchain IBM FTP
    baseurl=https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/toolchain/at/redhat/RHEL7
    failovermethod=priority
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/
    toolchain/at/redhat/RHELX/gpg-pubkey-6976a827-5164221b
    ```

-   To install the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

-   Replace the `USERNAME:PASSWORD` variable in the following command with the username and password of a registered EDB user:

    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

-   Before installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you must install the `epel-release` package:

    ```text
    # yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

    # yum makecache
    ```

-    Enable the `optional`, `extras`, and `HA` repositories to satisfy package dependencies:

    ```text
    subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms" --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"  --enable "rhel-ha-for-rhel-*-server-rpms"
    ```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d.` 

You must download and install the repository key. Provide the registered `username` and `password` with the `curl` command to download the repository key using the following command:

```text
curl -o /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

Use the following command to install the key:

```text
rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

Then, you can use `yum install` command to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server. For example, to install the server and its core components, use the command:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as14-server
    ```

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, `yum` may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter a `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

After installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you must configure the installation. For more information, see [Configuring a Package Installation](#configuring-a-package-installation).

!!! Note
    During the installation, `yum` may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it provides a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.
