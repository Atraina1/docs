## Installing on RHEL

You can use an RPM package to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on a RHEL host.

-   To install the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke one of the following platform specific commands:

    On RHEL 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

    On RHEL 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

-   Replace the `USERNAME:PASSWORD` variable in the following command with the username and password of a registered EDB user:

    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

-   Before installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you must install the `epel-release` package:

    On RHEL 7:

    ```text
    # yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

    # yum makecache
    ```

    On RHEL 8:

    ```text
    # dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

    # dnf makecache
    ```

-   Enable the repository:

    On RHEL 7, enable the `optional`, `extras`, and `HA` repositories to satisfy package dependencies:

    ```text
    subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms" --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"  --enable "rhel-ha-for-rhel-*-server-rpms"
    ```

    On RHEL 8, enable the `codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-*-rpms` repository to satisfy package dependencies:

    ```text
    ARCH=$( /bin/arch )

    subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"
    ```

    On RHEL 8, disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:

    ```text
    dnf -qy module disable postgresql
    ```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d.` 

You must download and install the repository key. Provide the registered `username` and `password` with the `curl` command to download the repository key using the following command:

```text
curl -o /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

Use the following command to install the key:

```text
rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

Then, you can use `yum install` or `dnf install` command to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server. For example, to install the server and its core components, use the command:

-   On RHEL 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as14-server
    ```

-   On RHEL 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install edb-as14-server
    ```

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, `yum` may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter a `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

After installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you must configure the installation. For more information, see [Configuring a Package Installation](#configuring-a-package-installation).

!!! Note
    During the installation, `yum` may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it provides a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.
