There are two steps to completing an installation:

- Setting up the repository
- Installing the package

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

Before setting up the repository, you need to register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

#### Setting up the repository

```shell
# Install the repository configuration
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# Register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
# Replace 'REGISTRATION_CODE' and 'EMAIL' with your SUSE registration information
SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'

# Activate the required SUSE modules on SUSE 15
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.3/x86_64

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh
```

#### Installing the package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-as14-server
```

After installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you must configure the installation. For more information, see [Configuring a Package Installation](#configuring-a-package-installation).
