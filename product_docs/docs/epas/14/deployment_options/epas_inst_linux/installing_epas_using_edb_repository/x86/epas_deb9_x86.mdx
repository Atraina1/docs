To install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on a Debian host, you must have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, visit:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request>

The following steps walk you through using the EDB apt repository to install a debian package. When using the commands, replace the `username` and `password` with the credentials provided by EDB.

-   Assume superuser privileges:

    ```text
    sudo su â€“
    ```

-   Configure the EDB repository and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the following command:

    ```text
    sh -c 'echo "deb https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    ```

-   Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

    ```text
    apt-get -y install apt-transport-https
    ```

-   Add the EDB signing key:

    ```text
    wget -q -O - https://apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key  | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

-   Update the repository metadata:

    ```text
    apt-get update
    ```

-   Install the package:

    ```text
    apt-get -y install edb-as14-server
    ```

!!! Note
    Some EDB Postgres Advanced Server supporting components require a Java installation. Before using a native package to add Migration Toolkit or EDB\*Plus to your system, make sure that Java version 8 is installed on your EDB Postgres Advanced Server host.
