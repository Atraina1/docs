You can deploy and install EDB products using the following methods:

- [BigAnimal](/biganimal) is a fully managed database-as-a-service with built-in Oracle compatibility, running in your cloud account and operated by the Postgres experts. BigAnimal makes it easy to set up, manage, and scale your databases. Provision PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server with Oracle compatibility.

- [Cloud Native PostgreSQL](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/kubernetes/cloud_native_postgresql/) is an operator designed by EnterpriseDB to manage PostgreSQL workloads on any supported Kubernetes cluster running in private, public, hybrid, or multi-cloud environments. Cloud Native PostgreSQL adheres to DevOps principles and concepts such as declarative configuration and immutable infrastructure.
- TPAexec
- Traditional installation
   - Installing on Linux
     - You can use the platform-specific package managers to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Advanced Server supporting components. The platform-specific package managers attempt to satisfy package dependencies as they install a package, but require access to the EDB Postgres Advanced Server repositories. See [Installing on Linux using the EDB Repository](epas/14/epas_inst_linux/01_epas_using_edb_repository).
     - If your system does not have access to a repository via the internet, you can use RPM to install a individual package or create a local repository for CentOS or RHEL, but you may be required to manually satisfy package dependencies. See [Installing on Linux using a Local Repository](/epas/14/epas_inst_linux/03a_using_a_local_repository).
