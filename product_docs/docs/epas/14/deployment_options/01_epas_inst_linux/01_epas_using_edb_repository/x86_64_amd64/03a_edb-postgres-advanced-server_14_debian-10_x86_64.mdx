This topic describes how to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server and includes two steps to completing an installation:

- Setting up the repository
- Installing the package

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

To log in as a superuser:

```sh
sudo su -
```

## Setting up the Repository

1. To register with EDB to receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

1. Setup the EDB repository

   ```sh
   echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list
   ```

1. Replace `<USERNAME>` and `<PASSWORD>` below with your username and password for the EDB repositories:

   ```sh
   echo "machine apt.enterprisedb.com login <USERNAME> password <PASSWORD>" > /etc/apt/auth.conf.d/edb.conf
   ```

1. Add support for secure APT repositories:

   ```sh
   apt-get -y install apt-transport-https
   ```

1. Replace `<USERNAME>`:`<PASSWORD>` with your repository username and password available from your [EDB account](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user) and add the EDB signing key:

   ```sh
   wget -q -O - https://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key  | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

1. Update the repository meta data:
   ```sh
   apt-get update
   ```

## Installing the Package

```sh
apt-get -y install edb-as14-server
```
