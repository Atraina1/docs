You can use the platform-specific package managers to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Advanced Server supporting components. The platform-specific package managers attempt to satisfy package dependencies as they install a package, but require access to the EDB Postgres Advanced Server repositories. See [Installing on Linux using the EDB Repository](epas/14/epas_inst_linux/01_epas_using_edb_repository).

If your system does not have access to a repository via the internet, you can use RPM to install a individual package or create a local repository for CentOS or RHEL, but you may be required to manually satisfy package dependencies. See [Installing on Linux using a Local Repository](/epas/14/epas_inst_linux/03a_using_a_local_repository).
