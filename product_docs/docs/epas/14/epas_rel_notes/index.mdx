With this Beta 1 release of EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14, EnterpriseDB continues to lead as the only worldwide company to deliver innovative and low-cost, open-source-derived database solutions with commercial quality, ease of use, compatibility, scalability, and performance for small or large-scale enterprises.

EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14 Beta 1 is built on open-source PostgreSQL 14 Beta 2, which introduces a myriad of enhancements that enable databases to scale up and scale out in more efficient ways. PostgreSQL 14 has features such as indexing enhancements, performance improvements, and modules such as `pg_amcheck` and `pg_surgery` that help DBAs during data corruption. PostgreSQL 14 is a level up in SQL syntaxes, data types, and has a multitude of other new features and capabilities.

EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14 Beta 1 adds a number of new features, including:

-   Creation and last DDL time for all SQL objects
-   Implementation of `SUBPARTITION TEMPLATE`
-   Enhancements to the `CONNECT BY` feature
-   Better audit log rotation
-   Support for object-level auditing

## EDB Postgres Advanced Server v14 Features

The major highlights of this release are:

-   Creation and last DDL time for all SQL objects
    
    Allows a user to track an object when it is created and last modified. Users can now view the created and last DDL time through respective Redwood-compatible views.



-  Implementation of `SUBPARTITION TEMPLATE`

   With the `SUBPARTITION TEMPLATE` clause, you can provide the subpartition descriptor to create subpartitions for each table partition. Specify the `TEMPLATE` once, and it gets applied to every partition automatically.
-  Access to a partition by `PARTITION (<partname>)` or subpartition by `SUBPARTITION (<subpartname>)` clause

   Allows access to the particular partition using the `PARTITION(<partname>)` clause and subpartition using the `SUBPARTITION(<subpartname>)` clause for `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, and `DELETE` queries.

-  `CONNECT BY` enhancements 

   -   `CONNECT BY` support has been generalized. The `CONNECT BY` expression can now be any SQL expression, which means that it can use operators such as AND and OR, and that it need not include the PRIOR keyword.

   -  `CONNECT_BY_ISCYCLE` and `NOCYCLE` are now supported

   -  `CONNNECT BY` queries can now include PRIOR in the target list



-  Support for object-level auditing
  
   Allows selective auditing of objects for specific DML statements such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` in the `edb_audit_statement` GUC, including or excluding certain groups. Allows users to either include `(@)` or exclude `(-)` particular statement type for a relation. Currently supports the `{SELECT | UPDATE | DELETE | INSERT}@groupname` statement type for a group. For more information see [Object Auditing](../epas_guide/03_database_administration/05_edb_audit_logging/09_object_auditing/).
-  Audit Log Archiver

   A new parameter `edb_audit_archiver` helps a DBA to control the space consumed by the audit log directory and manage the audit log files. The `edb_audit_archiver` parameter helps in compressing the old audit log files by specifying the compression command and executing the command before removing the old audit log files.
 
-  Support for `USERENV()`

   Provides user environment and session-related details.
 
-  Redwood-compatible bitwise `AND` and `OR` functions and aggregates
 
   Unlike existing bitwise functions and aggregates, these also support bitwise operation on a numeric data type for Redwood compatibility. In addition, there is support for bitwise '&' and '|' operators for the numeric data type.
-  Support for an alias on the table name in an `INSERT` statement

   You can use `ALIAS` to access a partition or subpartition with `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements to qualify the table columns. For example, `INSERT INTO table_name t (t.col1) VALUES (10);`
 
-  Option to audit the `SET` commands

   There is a new option in `edb_audit_statement` to log the `SET` commands. To enable this you need to modify the `log_statement` GUC.
 
-  `DBMS_SQL` compatible with Oracle

   The enhanced `DBMS_SQL` function accepts `NUMBER` instead of `INTEGER` so that both `INTEGER` to `NUMBER` functions can accept both `NUMBER` and `INTEGER` type values. Since these functions are compatible with both `NUMBER` and `INTEGER`, EDB Postgres Advanced Server restricts the input range within the `INTEGER`'s limit.
-  Create `ROWID` columns with `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA`

   When the remote table has a `rowid` column, the foreign table that gets created as part of the `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA` previously skipped the `rowid` column for a foreign table. Allows `rowids` columns to be created for the foreign table.
 
-  Global sequence for the `ROWID`s

  `ROWID` is now unique across the database, which allows using `ROWID`s on the partitioned table. 
 
-  `NVL2` uses `ANYCOMPATIBLE` pseudo-type

   Allows the `NVL2` function to support considerably more argument-type combinations. For example, the `NVL2` version can match a call with one `INTEGER` and multiple `BIGINT` arguments and the `INTEGER` is automatically promoted to `BIGINT`. With the previous `ANYELEMENT` version, you had to cast the `INTEGER` explicitly.

-   The `\h` command now displays the syntax on a psql prompt for EDB Postgres Advanced Server objects.
 
-   Tab-completion support for EDB Postgres Advanced Server syntaxes.
  
-  Improved Oracle compatibility syntax

   Allows you to migrate from Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server without applying syntax changes for the following:

   - `ENABLE` 
 
   - `USING INDEX ENABLE` 

   - `NOCYCLE` 
 
   - A sequence with a too high upper boundary. Now EDB Postgres Advanced Server applies the upper boundary and logs a warning message.
 
   - A sequence specifying the `NOORDER` keyword. The keyword is considered a `NOOP` keyword. A warning message is logged stating that the `NOORDER` keyword has no beneficial effect in EDB Postgres Advanced Server and is ignored.
