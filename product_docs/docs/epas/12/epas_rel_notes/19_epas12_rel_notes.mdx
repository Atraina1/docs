New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in EDB Postgres Advanced Server 12 include:

| Type        | Description      | 
| ----------- | ---------------- | 
| Feature     | Advanced Server now supports interval partitioning. Interval partitioning is an extension to range partitioning where the system automatically creates the partition if a new tuple doesn't fit into existing partitions. |
| Feature     | For better Redwood compatibility, Advanced Server now treats the `SELECT UNIQUE` clause synonymous to `SELECT DISTINCT` clause (that is, they can be used interchangeably in all places). |
| Feature     | Advanced Server now supports `COMPOUND TRIGGERS`. This provides a way to define a single trigger on a table that enables the user to specify actions for different DML event points. It allows defining `BEFORE STATEMENT`, `AFTER STATEMENT`, `BEFORE EACH ROW`, `AFTER EACH ROW` timing events in a single trigger. |
| Feature     | Advanced Server allows logical decoding on a standby server. With this feature, the user can now create a logical replication slot on standby server.  |
| Feature     | Advanced Server now provides `CAST(MULTISET..)`. `CAST(MULTISET)` is an extension to the redwood style casting function `CAST(.. AS ..)` where the subquery result is like a table output `CAST` to a collection type. |
| Feature     | Advanced Server now supports two aggregate functions: `LISTAGG` and `MEDIAN`. |
| Feature     | The `LISTAGG` function supports string aggregation that concatenates data from multiple rows into a single row in an ordered fashion. |
| Feature     | The `MEDIAN` function calculates a median value from the set of provided values. The aggregate function can be used with numeric, date/time and interval types and much like other aggregate functions, it can be used with window function as well. |
| Feature     | In addition to supporting `%type` and `%rowtype` variables for functions and procedures, Advanced Server now supports the same inside a package as well. |
| Feature     | Advanced Server now supports a Redwood compatible `to_timestamp` implementation, which facilitates stricter input string parsing for timestamp columns for EDB Loader. |
| Feature     | Advanced Server has re-implemented `ROWIDs` using identity data type after PG v12 PostgreSQL community removed support for `OIDs` (to which `ROWIDs` were mapped). |
| Feature     | Advanced Server has added the `SYS_GUID` function to generate and return a globally unique identifier in the form of 16-bytes of RAW data. |
| Feature     | Advanced Server now offers a new that provides information that is compatible with the Oracle data dictionary views: `{USER|ALL|DBA}_TAB_PRIVS`, `{USER|ALL|DBA}_COL_PRIVS`, and `{USER|ALL|DBA}_TAB_DEPENDENCIES`.|
