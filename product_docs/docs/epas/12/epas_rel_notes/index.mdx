EDB Postgres Advanced Server 12 is built on open-source PostgreSQL 12, which introduces myriad enhancements that enable databases to scale up and scale out in more efficient ways. PostgreSQL 12 has significant performance improvements, which includes an improved indexing and lookup system, a level up on query planning when using extended statistics, improved performance for queries that use aggregates or partitioned tables, and providing more ways to monitor activity within a PostgreSQL database. And along with highly requested features like parallelized vacuuming, incremental sorting, PostgreSQL 12 has a multitude of other new features and capabilities.
