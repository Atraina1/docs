EDB Postgres Advanced Server 12.5.6 includes the following bug fixes:

| Type | Description      | ID | Category |
| ---- | ---------------- | -- | -------- |
| Bug&nbsp;Fix | As ROWIDs are generated by the system internally, values for the rowid column are not dumped. Thus we should not dump the rowid sequence state using setval() too. Otherwise, it gives an error with data-only dump-restore. So skip dumping ROWID sequence state. [Support Ticket: #1095864] | DB&#8209;682 | |
| Bug Fix | Fixed crash with COPY FROM and/or foreign partition routing operations performed on libpq_dblink and oci_dblink FDW table. | DB-804 | |
| Bug Fix | Don't emit useless messages about GSS or SSL negotiation failures. Support Tickets: #1048322, #1048143, #1018659] | DB-770 | |
| Bug Fix | Allow dynamic partition creation to non-owner insert queries. Support Ticket: #1073281] | DB-769 | |
| Bug Fix | We create this system column for all the foreign tables. However, only oci_dblink and libpq_dblink FDWs use it and the code, assumes that this column is used with these two FDWs only. Which is wrong, this commit fixes the assertion failure when system column "__remote_rowid_" is selected.] |  DB-749 | |
