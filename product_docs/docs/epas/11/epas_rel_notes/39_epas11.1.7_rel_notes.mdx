New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11 include:

| Type        | Category       | Description      | 
| ----------- | -------------- | ---------------- | 
| Upstream Merge | | Merged with community PostgreSQL 11. See the community [Release Notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/release-11.html) for details. |         |           |
| Feature     | General Functionality | Advanced Server no longer creates the `dbo` system catalog in its databases.  |
| Feature     | General Functionality | Advanced Server now supports data redaction. Data redaction is a technique for limiting the exposure of sensitive data to certain users. Data redaction results in the alteration of the displayed data to such users. This is accomplished by defining redaction policies for tables with sensitive data. |
| Feature     | General Functionality | You can use the `edb_filter_log.redact_password_commands` extension to instruct the server to redact stored passwords from the log file. |
| Feature     | General Functionality | Advanced Server now supports EDB wait states, which is a background worker that probes each running session at a regular interval collecting information such as the database connection, the logged in user, the running query, and the wait events. |
| Feature     | General Functionality | Advanced Server now permits an infinite number of tries for custom plan generation if you set the `edb_custom_plan_tries` parameter to `-1`. |
| Feature     | General Functionality | The output format of the `version()` function has been changed to appear more consistent with the PostgreSQL community version output. |
| Feature     | General Functionality | Advanced Server now supports SPL standalone procedure overloading. Note that this feature is not compatible with Oracle databases. |
| Feature     | General Functionality | Advanced Server now supports the `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` directive within any SPL block to provide the autonomous transaction capability. |
| Feature     | General Functionality | Advanced server now offers performance improvements to libpq dblink and the OCI. |
| Enhancement | Partitioning   | Allow faster partition elimination during query processing; this speeds access to partitioned tables with many partitions. |
| Enhancement | Partitioning   | Allow partition elimination during query execution. |
| Enhancement | Partitioning   | Allow the creation of partitions based on hashing a key. |
| Enhancement | Partitioning   | Allow updated rows to automatically move to new partitions based on the new row contents. |
| Enhancement | Partitioning   | Allow partitioned tables to have a default partition. |
| Enhancement | Partitioning   | Allow `UNIQUE` indexes on partitioned tables if the partition key guarantees uniqueness. |
| Enhancement | Partitioning   | Allow indexes on a partitioned table to be automatically created in any child partitions. The new command `ALTER INDEX ATTACH PARTITION` allows indexes to be attached to partitions. This does not behave as a global index since the contents are private to each index. `WARN WHEN USING AN EXISTING INDEX?` |
| Enhancement | Partitioning   | Allow foreign keys on partitioned tables. |
| Enhancement | Partitioning   | Allow `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `COPY` on partitioned tables to properly route rows to foreign partitions. This is supported by `postgres_fdw` foreign tables.|
| Enhancement | Partitioning   | Allow `FOR EACH ROW` triggers on partitioned tables. |
| Enhancement | Partitioning   | Allow equality joins between partitioned tables with identically partitioned child tables to join the child tables directly. |
| Enhancement | Partitioning   | Perform aggregation on each partition, and then merge the results. |
| Enhancement | Partitioning   | Allow `postgres_fdw` to push down aggregates to foreign tables that are partitions. |
| Enhancement | Indexes        | |
| Enhancement | Optimizer      | |
| Enhancement | Performance    |  |
| Enhancement | Monitoring     |  |
| Enhancement | Authentication |  |
| Enhancement | Server Configuration |  |
| Enhancement | Streaming Replication and Recovery |  |
| Enhancement | Utility Commands |   |
| Enhancement | Data Types |  |
| Enhancement | Functions | |
| Bug Fix | XML Functions |   |
| Enhancement | PL/PgSQL | |
| Enhancement | Client Interfaces |  |
| Enhancement | Client Applications |  |
| Enhancement | psql |  |
| Enhancement | pgbench |  |
| Enhancement | Server Applications |  |
| Enhancement | pg_dump, pg_dumpall, pg_restore |  |
| Enhancement | Source Code |  |
| Enhancement | Additional Modules | |
