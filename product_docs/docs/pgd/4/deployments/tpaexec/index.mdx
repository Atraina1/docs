The standard way of deploying EDB Distributed Postgres in a self managed setting,
including physical and virtual machines, both self-hosted and in the cloud
(EC2) is to use EDB's deployment tool called TPAexec.

TPAexec is an orchestration tool that uses Ansible to build Postgres clusters as specified by TPA (Trusted Postgres Architecture), a set of reference architectures that document how to set up and operate Postgres in various scenarios. TPA represents the best practices followed by EDB, and its recommendations are as applicable to quick testbed setups as to production environments.

## Capabilities and supported software

### Configuration
The `tpaexec configure` command generates a simple YAML configuration file to describe a cluster, based on the options you select. The configuration is ready for immediate use, and you can modify it to better suit your needs. Editing the configuration file is the usual way to make any configuration changes to your cluster, both before and after it's created.

The configuration options include: 

| Flags                        | Description |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| --architecture BDR-Always-ON | Required. Produces a working configuration. |
| --layout layoutname          | Required. Specify one of the supported BDR use-case variations: bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. See [Choosing your architecture][/pgd/4/architectures] for more information. |
| --bdr-node-group groupname   | Optional. Set the name of the BDR node group. The default is bdrgroup. |
| --bdr-database dbname        | Optional. Set the name of the database with BDR enabled. The default is bdrdb. |
| --enable-camo                | Optional. Set the pair of BDR primary instances in each region to be each other's CAMO partners. |


```
[tpa]$ tpaexec configure ~/clusters/bdr \
         --architecture BDR-Always-ON \
         --layout gold \
         --platform aws --region eu-west-1 --instance-type t3.micro \
         --distribution Debian-minimal
```

You may also specify any of the options described in the online help for configure-options:
```
tpaexec help configure-options
```

### Provisioning
The `tpaexec provision` command creates instances and other resources required by the cluster. The details of the process depend on the architecture (for example, M1) and platform (for example, AWS) that you selected while configuring the cluster.

For example, given AWS access with the necessary privileges, TPAexec provisions EC2 instances, VPCs, subnets, routing tables, internet gateways, security groups, EBS volumes, elastic IPs, and so on.

You can also "provision" existing servers by selecting the "bare" platform and providing connection details. Whether these are bare metal servers or those provisioned separately on a cloud platform, they can be used just as if they had been created by TPAexec.

You are not restricted to a single platformâ€”you can spread your cluster out across some AWS instances (in multiple regions) and some on-premise servers, or servers in other data centres, as needed.

At the end of the provisioning stage, you will have the required number of instances with the basic operating system installed, which TPAexec can access via SSH (with sudo to root).

### Deployment
The `tpaexec deploy` command installs and configures Postgres and other software on the provisioned servers (which may or may not have been created by TPAexec; but it doesn't matter who created them so long as SSH and sudo access is available). This includes setting up replication, backups, and so on.

At the end of the deployment stage, Postgres is up and running.

### Testing
The `tpaexec test` command executes various architecture and platform-specific tests against the deployed cluster to ensure that it is working as expected.

At the end of the testing stage, you will have a fully-functioning cluster.

## Incremental changes
TPAexec is carefully designed so that provisioning, deployment, and testing are idempotent. You can run through them, make a change to config.yml, and run through the process again to deploy the change. If nothing has changed in the configuration or on the instances, then rerunning the entire process does not change anything either.

## Extensible through Ansible
TPAexec supports a variety of configuration options, so you can do a lot just by editing config.yml and re-running provision/deploy/test. Should you need to go beyond what is already implemented, you can write hook scripts to extend the deployment process.

This mechanism places the full range of Ansible functionality at your disposal during every stage of the deployment. For example, any tasks in hooks/pre-deploy.yml are executed before the main deployment; and there are also post-deploy and many other hooks.

## Cluster management
Once your cluster is up and running, TPAexec provides convenient cluster management functions, including configuration changes, switchover, and zero-downtime minor-version upgrades. These features make it easier and safer to manage your cluster than making the changes by hand.

## It's just Postgres
TPAexec can create complex clusters with many features configured, but the result is just Postgres. The installation follows some conventions designed to make life simpler, but there is no hidden magic or anything standing in the way between you and the database. You can do everything on a TPA cluster that you could do on any other Postgres installation.
