EDB Postgres Distributed provides loosely-coupled multi-master logical replication
using a mesh topology. This means that you can write to any server and the
changes will be sent directly, row-by-row to all the
other servers that are part of the same mesh.

EDB Postgres Distributed consists of several components that make the whole
cluster work.

## Postgres server

Three different Postgres distributions can be used:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - open source
- [EDB Postgres Extended Server](https://techsupport.enterprisedb.com/customer_portal/sw/2ndqpostgres/) - PostgreSQL compatible and optimized for replication
- [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest) - Oracle compatible, optimized for replication, and additional enterprise features

What Postgres distribution and version is right for you depends on the features you need
please refer to the feature matrix for detailed comparison.

## Postgres extensions

### BDR

A Postgres server with the BDR extension installed will be referred to as a BDR
node. BDR nodes be either data nodes or witness nodes.

Witness nodes don't participate in data replication, and are only used as a
tie-breaker for consensus.

### pglogical3 (3.6/3.7)

pglogical is a Postgres extension that provides logical replication using
logical decoding since Postgres 9.4.

Older versions of BDR (3.6/3.7) depend on pglogical3 to provide the replication
channel upon which BDR builds.

## HARP

HARP is connection management tool for BDR cluster.

It leverages consensus-driven quorum to determine the correct connection end-point
in a semi-exclusive manner to prevent unintended multi-node writes from an
application. This reduces the potential for data conflicts.
