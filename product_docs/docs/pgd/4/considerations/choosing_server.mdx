title: "Choosing a Postgres distribution"
---

Some key features of EDB Postgres Distributed depend on Postgres distribution being used: PostgeSQL, EDB Postgres Extended Server, or EDB Postgres Advanced Server. Therefore, it is essential to adopt the Postgres distribution best suited to your business needs. For example, if having the feature "Commit At Most Once (CAMO)" is mission critical to a your use case, you should not adopt open source PostgreSQL because it does not have the core capabilities required to handle CAMO. The full feature matrix compatibility can be found in Feature Compatibility appendix.

The following table lists features of EDB Postgres Distributed and whether they are supported by given distribution and version of Postgres.
