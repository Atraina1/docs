title: "Choosing durability"
---

These are the considerations for choosing your architecture based on durability:
- Async replication for speed
  - Multiple types of conflict detection
  - Column-level conflict resolution
  - Conflict triggers
  - Foreign key handlers
  - Commit at most once (CAMO)
- Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)
- Sync replication for consistency
  - Eager replication
