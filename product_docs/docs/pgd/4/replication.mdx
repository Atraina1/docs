Provides the essential multi-master capabilities for PostgreSQL clusters:

- Enables application and database upgrades without requiring downtime [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/appusage/#replicating-between-different-release-levels) [2](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/appusage/#replicating-between-nodes-with-differences)
- Provides clusters row level eventual consistency by default [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/conflicts/#data-verification-with-livecompare)
- Concurrent streaming of large transactions smooths replication and reduces lag [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/transaction-streaming/)
- Tools to monitor operation [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/monitoring/#monitoring-outgoing-replication) and verify data consistency [2](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/tssnapshots/)

Includes advanced conflict management [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/conflicts/), data-loss protection [2](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/lag-control/), and up to 5X throughput [3](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/camo/#:~:text=To%20artificially%20throttle,this%20delay%20accordingly.):

- Guards applications from committing transactions more than once [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/camo/)
- Conflict-free synchronous replication with two phase commit [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/twophase/) [2](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/eager/)
- Concurrent updates using conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/crdt/)
- Configurable column level conflict resolution [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/column-level-conflicts/) along with customizable conflict handling and transformation [2](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/conflicts/#conflict-resolution)

New in EDB Postgres Distributed 4.1:

- Faster, fully online major version upgrades [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/release_notes/bdr4.1.0_rel_notes/#:~:text=Support%20in%2Dplace,a%20BDR%20cluster.)
- Replication lag control [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/lag-control/) with asynchronous replication [2](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/overview/#asynchronous-by-default)
- More flexibility for durable replication with Group Commit [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/group-commit/)
- Greater control with command line interface [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/nodes/#node-management-commands)
- Simplified synchronous replication configuration with SQL level interface [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/nodes/#node-management-interfaces)
- Automatic management of distributed sequences [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/sequences/#global-sequence-management-interfaces)

Additional features:

- Automatic DDL and DML replication in an active-active mesh network [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/ddl/#:~:text=Automatic%20DDL%20replication%20makes%20certain%20DDL%20changes%20easier%20without%20having%20to%20manually%20distribute%20the%20DDL%20change%20to%20all%20nodes%20and%20ensure%20that%20they%20are%20consistent.)
- Failover and switchover infrastructure to re-route traffic in case of failures or during maintenance operation [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/overview/#characterizing-bdr-performance)
- Advanced conflict detection and conflict management [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/column-level-conflicts/)
- Differentiated replication sets to control which data gets replicated and to which downstream databases [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/repsets/)
- Cluster expansion/consolidation [1?](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/scaling/#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20AutoPartition%20manages%20partitions%20globally.%20In%20other%20words%2C%20when%20a%20partition%20is%20created%20on%20one%20node%2C%20the%20same%20partition%20is%20also%20created%20on%20all%20other%20nodes%20in%20the%20cluster.%20So%20all%20partitions%20are%20consistent%20and%20guaranteed%20to%20be%20available.)
- Rolling schema change/migration using cross-schema replication [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/appusage/#replicating-between-nodes-with-differences)
- Recovery from user error through solid integration with backup and recovery tools [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/functions/#bdrconsensus_snapshot_import)
- Improved security model with Geo-fencing, allowing selectively replicate data for security compliance and jurisdiction control [1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/lag-control/#:~:text=Group%20elasticity%20objective%20(GEO)%20ensures%20that,contract%20the%20number%20of%20database%20nodes.)
