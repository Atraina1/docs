Provides the essential multi-master capabilities for PostgreSQL clusters:

- Enables application and database upgrades without requiring downtime
    - [Replicating between different release levels](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/appusage/#replicating-between-different-release-levels)
    - [Replicating between nodes with differences](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/appusage/#replicating-between-nodes-with-differences)
- Provides clusters row level eventual consistency by default 
    - [Data verification with LiveCompare](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/conflicts/#data-verification-with-livecompare)
- Concurrent streaming of large transactions smooths replication and reduces lag
    - [Transaction streaming](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/transaction-streaming/)
- Tools to monitor operation and verify data consistency
    - [Monitoring outgoing replication](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/monitoring/#monitoring-outgoing-replication)
    - [Timestamp-based snapshots](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/tssnapshots/)

Includes advanced conflict management, data-loss protection, and up to 5X throughput:

- Concurrent updates using conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)
    - [Confict-free replicated data types](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/crdt/)
- Configurable column level conflict resolution along with customizable conflict handling and transformation
    - [Column-level conflcit resolution](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/column-level-conflicts/)

    - [Conflict resolution](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/conflicts/#conflict-resolution)
- Differentiated replication sets to control which data gets replicated and to which downstream databases
    - [Replication sets](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/repsets/)
- Cluster expansion/consolidation
    - [AutoPartition?](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/scaling/)
