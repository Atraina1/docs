title: "Choosing the database server distribution"
---

It is important to note that some key BDR features depend on certain core capabilities being available within the targeted PostgresSQL database server. Therefore, it is essential for the BDR customers to also adopt the PostgresSQL database server flavor that is best suited to their business needs. For example, if having the BDR feature "Commit At Most Once (CAMO)" is mission critical to a BDR customerâ€™s use case, they should not adopt the community PostgreSQL flavor for it does not have the core capability required to handle CAMO. The full feature matrix compatibility can be found in Feature Compatibility appendix.

The following table lists features of BDR and whether they are supported by
given variant of Postgres and optionally from which version.
