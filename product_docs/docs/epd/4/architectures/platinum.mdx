The Always On Platinum architecture includes the following:

-  Four BDR nodes (two in location A, two in location B)
-  Two logical standbys (one in location A, one in location B)
-  Two Barman nodes (one in location A, one in location B)
-  One witness node in location C (optional but recommended)
-  4 pgBouncer/HAProxy Nodes (2 in location A, two in location B)

Both locations have redundant hot standby hardware to maintain local high availability in case of a hardware failure without waiting to restore a BDR node from backup.
