The Always On Silver architecture includes the following:

-  Three BDR nodes; each node has data
-  Redundant hardware to quickly restore failover capability
-  Barman offsite (offsite is optional but recommended)
-  Two pgBouncer/HAProxy nodes

BDR nodes can also be spread across AZs, and Barman can be located in location A.
