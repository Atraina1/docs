title: "Remote Monitoring Capabilities"
---

Remote monitoring is when your database cluster and PEM Agent are on different host.

The following scenarios require remote monitoring if you are using PEM:

- [Postgres database cluster running on AWS RDS](../pem_admin/03_pem_define_aws_instance_connection/#monitoring-a-postgres-instance-running-on-aws-ec2S)
- [EDB Cloud cluster](../edbcloud/latest/using_cluster/05_monitoring_and_logging/)

To enable remote monitoring, see [Registering a Server](../pem_admin/02_registering_server).

As the PEM Agent will be monitoring remotely, the functionality will be limited as described below:
