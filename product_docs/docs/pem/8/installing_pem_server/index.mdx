The two primary deployment options for Postgres Enterprise Manager are a standalone server or a high availability environment.

To deploy a standalone server, see:
-   [Installing on Linux]()
-   [Installing on Windows]()

To deploy a high availability environment, see [Setup high availability using Failover Manger]().

For either of the options, you can deploy connection pooling. For more details, see [Connection pooling using pgBouncer]().
