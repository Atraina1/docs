## Hardware prerequisites

For optimum performance when monitoring servers and rendering dashboards, we recommend installing PEM on a system with at least:

-   4 CPU cores
-   8 GB of RAM
-   100 GB of Storage

Additional disk space is required for data storage. Please note that resource usage will vary based on which probes are defined and enabled, and the activity level on the monitored databases. Monitoring server resources (as you use PEM) will let you know when you need to expand your initial system configuration.

## Software prerequisites

1.  Install a backend database.

    When installing a PEM server on a Linux host, you must first install a backend database cluster which will hold the `pem` database. The PEM serverâ€™s backend database may be installed via package for Linux. The backend database must be one of the following versions:

    -   EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 11 or above

    -   PostgreSQL version 11 or above

    For detailed information about installing an Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database, please see the product documentation at the EDB website.

2.  Configure Postgres authentication on the backend database.

    The `pg_hba.conf` file manages connections for the Postgres server. You must ensure that the `pg_hba.conf` file on each monitored server allows connections from the PEM server, the monitoring PEM Agent, and the host of the Apache web server in Linux (PEM-HTTPD in Windows) server.

    For information about modifying the `pg_hba.conf` file, see the [PEM Administrator's Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pem/latest/pem_admin/).

    Information about managing authentication is also available in the [Postgres core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).


3.  Ensure that the `sslutils` extension and `hstore` contrib module are installed on your backend database.

    -   On an Advanced Server backend database, the `sslutils` extension and `hstore` contrib module are by default installed along with Advanced Server.

    -   If you are using a PostgreSQL backend database, ensure you have access to the PostgreSQL community repository, and then install `sslutils` extension and `hstore` contrib module. Use the applicable install command for your operating system:

    For RHEL/OL/CentOS 7,

    ```text
    yum install postgresql_<x>_sslutils postgresql<X>-contrib 
    ```

    Where, `x` is the server version.

    For RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux/OL 8

    ```text
    dnf install postgresql_<x>_sslutils postgresql<X>-contrib
    ```

    Where, `x` is the server version.

    For Debian/Ubuntu,

    ```text
    apt install postgresql_<x>_sslutils postgresql<X>-contrib
    ```
    
    Where, `x` is the server version.

    For SLES,

    ```text
    zypper install postgresql-<x>_sslutils postgresql<X>-contrib
    ```

    Where, `x` is the server version.

    !!! Note
        Debian 10 and Ubuntu 20 has increased the requirements to accept the certificates due to security reason. 
        -   If a user wants to install the PEM agent on any of the machines, they must upgrade `ssltuils` to 1.3 where 4096 bit RSA key and sha256 signature algorithm support has added.
        -   If a user does not upgrade `sslutils` to 1.3, then PEM agent may fail to connect to the PEM backend database server, and it might log the error `ca md too weak`.
     

4.  Adjust your firewall restrictions.

    If you are using a firewall, you must allow access to port `8443` on the PEM backend database:

    For RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux/OL/CentOS,
    
    ```text
    firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8443/tcp
     
    firewall-cmd --reload
    ```

    For Debian/Ubuntu,

    ```text
    iptables -t filter -A INPUT -p TCP --dport 8443 -j ACCEPT
    ```

5.  PEM is dependent on third-party components from the vendor repository, including the python3, libboost, openssl, snmp++, libcurl, etc. To ensure these components are up to date, you should update your operating system using following platform-specific commands. Minimum version require for openssl is 1.0.2k.

    To upgrade packages on a RHEL/OL/CentOS 7.x host

    ```text
    yum upgrade
    ```

    To upgrade packages on a RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux/OL 8.x host

    ```text
    dnf upgrade
    ```

    To upgrade packages on a Debian/Ubuntu host

    ```text
    apt-get update
    ```

    To upgrade packages on a SLES host

    ```text
    zypper update
    ```

6.  Supported locales

    Currently, the PEM server and web interface support a locale of `English(US) en_US` and use of a period (.) as a language separator character. Using an alternate locale, or a separator character other than a period may result in errors.
