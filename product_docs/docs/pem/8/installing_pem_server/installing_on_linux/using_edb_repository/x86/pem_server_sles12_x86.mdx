Follow these steps to completing an installation:

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Setting up the repository](#setting-up-the-repository)
- [Installing the package](#installing-the-package)
- [Performing the initial configuration](#initial-configuration)

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

## Prerequisites


1.  Install an Advanced Server or PostgresSQL database server to hold the `pem` backend database. Configure the Postgres authentication on the backend database. For more details see [Software prerequisites](). 

2.  Ensure that the `sslutils` extension and `hstore` contrib module are installed on your backend database.

    -   On an Advanced Server backend database, the `sslutils` extension and `hstore` contrib module are by default installed along with Advanced Server.

    -   If you are using a PostgreSQL backend database, ensure you have access to the PostgreSQL community repository, and then install `sslutils` extension and `hstore` contrib module. Use the applicable install command for your operating system:

    ```text
    zypper install postgresql-<x>_sslutils postgresql<X>-contrib
    ```

    Where, `x` is the server version.

3.  Adjust your firewall restrictions.

    If you are using a firewall, you must allow access to port `8443` on the PEM backend database:

    ```text
    firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8443/tcp
     
    firewall-cmd --reload
    ```

4.  PEM is dependent on third-party components from the vendor repository, including the python3, libboost, openssl, snmp++, libcurl, etc. To ensure these components are up to date, you should update your operating system using following platform-specific commands. Minimum version require for openssl is 1.0.2k.

    ```text
    zypper update
    ```

5.  Supported locales

    Currently, the PEM server and web interface support a locale of `English(US) en_US` and use of a period (.) as a language separator character. Using an alternate locale, or a separator character other than a period may result in errors.

Before setting up the repository, you need to register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

## Setting up the Repository

```shell
# Install the repository configuration and enter your EDB repository
# credentials when prompted
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# Register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
# You can skip this step if already registered
# Replace 'REGISTRATION_CODE' and 'EMAIL' with your SUSE registration information
SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'

# Activate the required SUSE modules on SUSE 12
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/x86_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/x86_64

# Install the following repository for PEM dependencies
zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache:/Modules/SLE_12_SP5/Apache:Modules.repo

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh
```

## Installing the Package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-pem
```

## Initial Configuration

```shell
# You can configure the PEM server using the following command:
/usr/edb/pem/bin/configure-pem-server.sh
```

For more details, see [Configuring the PEM Server on Linux](../../configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux/).
