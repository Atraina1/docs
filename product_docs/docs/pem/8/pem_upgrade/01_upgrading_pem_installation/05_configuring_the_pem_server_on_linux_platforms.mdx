After upgrading the PEM Server you can use the following command to configure the PEM Server:

```text
/usr/edb/pem/bin/configure-pem-server.sh
```

While running the configure script, it will take the values from the old PEM Server configuration file and run the script.

After executing the PEM server configuration file, use your version-specific service control command to restart the `httpd` service.

For detailed information about using an RPM package to install or configure the PEM server or PEM Agent, please see the [PEM Linux Installation Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pem/latest/pem_inst_guide_linux/).
