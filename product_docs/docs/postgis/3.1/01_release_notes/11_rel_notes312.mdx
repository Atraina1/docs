| Type            | Description                                                                                                                                      |

| Upstream Merges | Merged with community PostGIS 3.1.2. See the community [Release Notes](https://postgis.net/docs/manual-3.1/release_notes.html#idm41899) for details. |
| Bug Fix         | Improved handling of more complex compound coordinate systems.                                                              |
| Bug Fix         | The SRID in TopoGeometry is fixed for empty geometry objects.                                                                                                   |
| Bug Fix         | Improved message when no zip code is provided for `postgis_tiger_geocoder`.                                                                                                 |
| Bug Fix         | Axis flips are now done for a CRS when `Lat` is set as the first column. In other cases, EPSG database order is used.                                                               |
| Bug Fix         | Support recent Proj versions that have removed `pj_get_release`.                                                                                                   |
| Bug Fix         | The tolerance is now adjusted to improve geodetic calculations.                                                                                                 |
| Bug Fix         | Fix on improper conversion of negative geographic azimuth to positive.                                                               |
| Bug Fix         | Allow DBSCAN cluster to form when recordset length equal to minPoints.                                                                                                   |
| Bug Fix         | Ensure bounding boxes are refreshed after coordinate transforms.                                                                                                 |
| Bug Fix         | Fix raster issues related to PostgreSQL 14 tablefunc changes.                                                               |
| Bug Fix         | Update to support Tiger 2020.                                                                                                   |
| Bug Fix         | Change Proj cache lifetime to last as long as connection.                                                                                                 |




!!! Note
    To upgrade from PostGIS version 2.5.4 (or lower) to 3.1.2, you must perform the following  actions:
     -  Since the return type of the raster functions have changed, you must drop and re-create the raster extension as part of the upgrade process. 
     - Before upgrading to version 3.1.2,  you must upgrade to 3.1.1 first as an intermediate step.
     - When the PostGIS data has a dependency on the raster functions, upgrading to PostGIS 3.1.2 requires dumping and reloading the data.

    See the [upgrade section](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgis/latest/03_upgrading_postgis/) for details.
