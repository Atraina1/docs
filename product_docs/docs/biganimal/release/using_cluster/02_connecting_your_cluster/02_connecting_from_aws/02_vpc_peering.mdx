title: VPC peering example

---

This example shows how to connect using VPC peering. 

!!! Note
    Ensure that your VPCs do not have overlapping IPv4 CIDR blocks. If they do, the status of the VPC peering connection immediately goes to failed. This limitation applies even if the VPCs have unique IPv6 CIDR blocks.
    
<!-- What is BigAnimal's address space in AWS? -->

Assume that your cluster is on a account called `development` and is being accessed from a Linux client VM on another account called `test` with the following properties:

-   Cluster:
    -   AWS account name: `development`
    -   Cluster ID: `p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg` 
    -   Account ID: `brcxzr08qr7rbei1` 
    -   Organization's domain name: `biganimal.io` 
    -   VPC: `vpc-cluster`
    -   VPC ID: ``
 [Need to provide a sample name for VPC ID


-   Linux client VM called `vm-client`:
    -   Subscription: `test`
    -   VPC: `vpc-client`
    -   VPC subnet: `snet-client`
    -   VPC ID: ``
    <!-- Need to provide a sample name for VPC ID -->


#### Prerequisites

To walk through an example in your own environment, you need:

-   Your cluster URL. You can find the URL in the **Connect** tab of your cluster instance in the BigAnimal portal.
-   The IP address of your cluster. You can find the IP address of your cluster using the following command:

    ```
    $ dig +short p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg.brcxzr08qr7rbei1.biganimal.io 
    10.240.1.218
    ```
-   A Postgresql client, such as [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), installed on your client VM.

You need to add two peering links, one from the client VPC `vpc-client` and the other from your cluster's VPC `vnet-japaneast`. 

## VPC peering connection with a VPC in another AWS account

You can create a VPC peering connection with a VPC in the same Region, or a different Region.

### To request a VPC peering connection with a VPC in another account

1. Log in to the AWS account associated with your BigAnimal account.

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Peering Connections**, and then click **Create Peering Connection**.

1. Enter a suitable name for the peering connection.

1. For **VPC (Requester)**, select the cluster's VPC in your account.

1. Select **Another account**.

1. Enter the AWS account ID of the owner of the accepter VPC.

1.(Optional) select **Another region**, and then select the Region in which the accepter VPC resides.
 
1. For **VPC (Accepter)**, enter the ID of the client VPC.

1. Select **Create Peering Connection**.

1. In the confirmation dialog box, select **OK**.

1. Your application's cloud administrator must log in to the client AWS account and repeat this procedure with the client VPC as the requester and the cluster VPC as the accepter.

## VPC peering connection with another VPC in your account 

You can create a VPC peering connection with a VPC in the same Region, or a different Region.

### To create a VPC peering connection with a VPC in the same region

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Peering Connections**, and then click **Create Peering Connection**.

1. For **VPC (Requester)**, select the cluster VPC in your account.

1. Ensure **My account** is selected. 
 
1. Select **Another VPC to peer with** and then select **Add tag** and enter the key-value pair of the VPC you want to connect with.

1. Select **Create Peering Connection**.

1. In the confirmation dialog box, select **OK**.

1. Select the VPC peering connection that you've created, select **Actions**, and then select **Accept Request**.

 In the confirmation dialog, select **Yes, Accept**. A second confirmation dialog displays; select Modify my route tables now to go directly to the route tables page, or select Close to do this later.

 <!-- Is there any recommendation for the user here? -->

1. Repeat this procedure with the client VPC as the requester and the cluster VPC as the accepter.

### To create a VPC peering connection with a VPC in a different Region

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.

1. In the navigation pane, select Peering Connections, Create Peering Connection.

1. You can optionally name your VPC peering connection. Doing so creates a tag with a key of Name and a value that you specify.

1. Select the requester VPC in your account with which to request the VPC peering connection.

1. Ensure **My account** is selected.

1. Select **Another region**, and then select the Region in which the accepter VPC resides.

1. Enter the ID of the accepter VPC.

1. Select **Create Peering Connection**.

1. In the confirmation dialog box, select **OK**.

1. Select the region of the accepter VPC in the upper right corner of the AWS console.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Peering Connections**. Select the VPC peering connection that you've created, select Actions, and then select **Accept Request**.

1. In the confirmation dialog, select **Yes, Accept**. A second confirmation dialog displays; select Modify my route tables now to go directly to the route tables page, or select Close to do this later.
 
1. Now that your VPC peering connection is active, you must add an entry to your VPC route tables to enable traffic to be directed between the peered VPCs. For more information, see Update your route tables for a VPC peering connection.
 <!-- Is there any specific recommendation for the user here? -->

1. Access the cluster with its domain name from your cluster's connection string. It's accessible from `vpc-client` after peering.
