## VPC peering connection with a VPC in another AWS account

Before you begin, ensure that you have the AWS account number and VPC ID of the VPC to peer with.

After you've created the request, the owner of the accepter VPC must accept the VPC peering connection to activate it.

You can create a VPC peering connection with a VPC in the same Region, or a different Region.

Important
If the VPCs have overlapping IPv4 CIDR blocks, or if the account ID and VPC ID are incorrect or do not correspond with each other, the status of the VPC peering connection immediately goes to failed.

### To request a VPC peering connection with a VPC in another account in the same Region

Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.

In the navigation pane, choose Peering Connections, Create Peering Connection.

Configure the information as follows, and choose Create Peering Connection when you are done:

Peering connection name tag: You can optionally name your VPC peering connection. Doing so creates a tag with a key of Name and a value that you specify. This tag is only visible to you; the owner of the peer VPC can create their own tags for the VPC peering connection.

VPC (Requester): Select the VPC in your account with which to create the VPC peering connection.

Account: Choose Another account.

Account ID: Enter the AWS account ID of the owner of the accepter VPC.

VPC (Accepter): Enter the ID of the VPC with which to create the VPC peering connection.

In the confirmation dialog box, choose OK.

### To request a VPC peering connection with a VPC in another account in a different Region

Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.

In the navigation pane, choose Peering Connections, Create Peering Connection.

Configure the information as follows, and choose Create Peering Connection when you are done:

Peering connection name tag: You can optionally name your VPC peering connection. Doing so creates a tag with a key of Name and a value that you specify. This tag is only visible to you; the owner of the peer VPC can create their own tags for the VPC peering connection.

VPC (Requester): Select the VPC in your account with which to create the VPC peering connection.

Account: Choose Another account.

Account ID: Enter the AWS account ID of the owner of the accepter VPC.

Region: Choose Another region, select the Region in which the accepter VPC resides.

VPC (Accepter): Enter the ID of the VPC with which to create the VPC peering connection.

In the confirmation dialog box, choose OK.

The VPC peering connection that you've created is not active. To activate it, the owner of the accepter VPC must accept the VPC peering connection request. To enable traffic to be directed to the peer VPC, update your VPC route table. For more information, see Update your route tables for a VPC peering connection.

## VPC peering connection with another VPC in your account 

ensure that you have the IDs of the VPCs with which you are creating the VPC peering connection. You must both create and accept the VPC peering connection request yourself to activate it.

You can create a VPC peering connection with a VPC in the same Region, or a different Region.

Important
Ensure that your VPCs do not have overlapping IPv4 CIDR blocks. If they do, the status of the VPC peering connection immediately goes to failed. This limitation applies even if the VPCs have unique IPv6 CIDR blocks.

### To create a VPC peering connection with a VPC in the same Region

Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.

In the navigation pane, choose Peering Connections, Create Peering Connection.

Configure the following information, and choose Create Peering Connection when you are done:

Peering connection name tag: You can optionally name your VPC peering connection.
