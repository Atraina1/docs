title: Connecting from AWS 

---

The VPC endpoint method is recommended and is most commonly used to enable you to connect to your cluster from your application's VPC in AWS. However, you can implement either of the other solutions depending on your organization's requirements.

- VPC endpoint method
- VPC peering connection with a VPC in another AWS account
- VPC peering connection with another VPC in your account

In case the customer is using a different AWS Account other than the one where BigAnimal is (preferred option:)

same AWS Account as bigAnimal, different VPC:
