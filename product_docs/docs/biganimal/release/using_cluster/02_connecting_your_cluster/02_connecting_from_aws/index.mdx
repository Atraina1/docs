title: Connecting from AWS 

---

Two different methods enable you to connect to your private cluster from your application's VPC in AWS. Each method offers different levels of accessibility and security. The VPC endpoint method is recommended and is most commonly used. However, you can also use the VPC peering connection method if required by your organization.

- VPC endpoint method
- VPC peering connection method

## AWS PrivateLink service (recommended)

 AWS PrivateLink service is a network interface that securely connects a private IP 
 address from your AWS VPC to an external service. You grant access only to a single cluster instead of the entire BigAnimal resource VPC, thus ensuring maximum network isolation. For more information, see [VPC endpoint services (AWS PrivateLink)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/endpoint-service.html).

**Pros**

-   You need to configure the PrivateLink only once. Then you can use multiple PrivateLinks to connect applications from many different VPCs.
-   There's no risk of IP address conflicts.

**Cons**

-   PrivateLinks (required by PrivateLink services) are not free. See [Azure Private Link pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/private-link/#pricing).

See the [PrivateLink service Example](01_vpc_endpoint) for the steps for connecting using this method.

## VPC peering

VPC peering connects two AWS VPCs, allowing traffic to be freely routed between the two. Once peered, the two VPCs act as one with respect to connectivity. Network Security Group rules are still observed.

**Pros**

-   Simple and easy to set up.

**Cons**

-   There is an associated cost. See [pricing for VPC peering](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-network/#pricing) for details.
-   The IP ranges of two peered VPCs can't overlap. BigAnimal VPCs use the 10.240.0.0/16 address space and can't be peered with VPCs using this same space.

See the [VPC Peering Example](02_vpc_peering) for the steps to connect using this VPC Peering.

## AWS VPC-VPC connection

VPC-VPC connections use VPN gateways to send encrypted traffic between Azure VPCs.

**Pros**

-   Cluster domain name is directly accessible without a NAT. 
-   VPCs from different accounts don't need to be associated with the same Active Directory tenant.
[Not sure if this applies????]()

**Cons**

-   Bandwidth is limited. See [VPC gateway planning table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways#planningtable). 
-   Configuration is complicated.
-   There is an associated cost. See [VPC gateway planning table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways#planningtable).

See the [VPC-VPC Example](03_VPC_VPC) for the steps for connecting using VPC-VPC Connection.
