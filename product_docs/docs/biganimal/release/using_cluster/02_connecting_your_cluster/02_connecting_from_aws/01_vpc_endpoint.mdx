title: VPC endpoint example

---

This example shows how to connect your cluster using VPC endpoints.

Assume that your cluster is on a account called `development` and is being accessed from a Linux client VM on another account called `test` with the following properties:

-   Cluster:
    -   AWS account: `development`
    -   Amazon resource name (ARN): `arn:aws:iam::123456789123:root`
    -   Cluster ID: `p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg` 
    -   Account ID: `brcxzr08qr7rbei1` 
    -   Organization's domain name: `biganimal.io` 


-   Linux client VM called `vm-client`:
    -   AWS account: `test`
    -   Resource group: `rg-client`
    -   VPC: `vpc-client`
    -   VPC subnet: `snet-client`

## Prerequisites

To walk through an example in your own environment, you need:

- Your cluster URL. You can find the URL in the Connect tab of your cluster instance in the BigAnimal portal.
 

## Step 1: Create an endpoint service for your cluster

In this example, you create an endpoint service to expose your cluster to other VPCs in other AWS Accounts. Perform this procedure for every cluster that you want to connect to in AWS.

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/. Ensure that the correct region, where your cluster is deployed, is selected in the upper-right corner of the console.

1. In the navigation pane, under Load Balancing, choose **Load Balancers**.

1. You can see a list of load balancers, and each load balancer is tagged with the ID of the cluster to which it is deployed (service.k8s.aws/stack: default/*<cluster_ID>*). For example, service.k8s.aws/stack: default/p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg.

1. Identify the load balancer that is tagged with the ID of the cluster to which you want to connect. Note the name of that network load balancer.

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/. 

1. Select **Endpoint Services** under Virtual Private Cloud from the navigation pane on the left and then select **Create endpoint service**.

1. Enter a suitable name for the endpoint service.

1. Select **Network** for the Load balancer type.

1. Under **Available load balancers**, select the network load balancer of the cluster to which you want to connect. 
 
1. Leave all the other fields with their default values and select **Create**. Note the **Service name** of the created AWS PrivateLink, because you will require it while creating a VPC endpoint.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Endpoint Services**.

1. Select your endpoint service and from the Actions dropdown and select **Allow principals**.
 
1. Add the AWS account that will connect to the PrivateLink by specifying the ARN for the principal. The ARN must be in this format:

 arn:aws:iam::&lt;AWS ACCOUNT ID&gt;:root


## Step 2: Create a VPC endpoint in the client's VPC

Now that your endpoint service is created, you can connect it to the cluster VPC using a VPC endpoint.

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.

1. Ensure that the correct region, where your cluster is deployed, is selected in the upper-right corner of the console.   

1. Select **Endpoints** under Virtual Private Cloud from the navigation pane on the left and then select **Create endpoint**.

1. Enter a suitable name for the endpoint service.

1. Under Service category, select **Other endpoint services**.

1. Under Service Name, enter the name of the endpoint service that you created earlier (for example, com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0e123abc123198abc). Verify whether you successfully allowed access to the endpoint by selecting **Verify service**.

1. Under VPC, select the client's VPC in which to create the endpoint. 

1. Under Subnets, select the subnets (availability zones) in which to create the endpoint network interfaces. We recommend:
 -  Enabling the endpoint in all availability zones used by your application. 
 - Creating a security group that allows your application to connect to your cluster.

1. Select **Create endpoint**

## Step 3: Accept the connection in BigAnimal

Go back to your BigAnimal AWS Account onto VPC -> Endpoint services. Select the one you created previously and accept the connection. 
<!-- Do we have the UI/figma ready for this? -->

You can now successfully connect to your cluster.

In your application's AWS account select **DNS names**. Use the DNS for the VPC endpoint in the details section and access your cluster with this private domain name.
