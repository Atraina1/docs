title: Deleting your cluster
---

If you no longer need a particular cluster, you can delete it from the BigAnimal portal. You also need to reach out to EDB's BigAnimal Support team to stop the management costs; otherwise, costs may continue to accumulate.

To delete your cluster:
1. Select the cluster you wish to restore on the [**Clusters**](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page in the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal. 
2. From **Quick Actions**, select **Delete**.
3. Follow the prompts to confirm the action.

To contact Support to stop the associated management costs, see [Support options](../overview/06_support/).

For more information on management costs see [Pricing and billing](../pricing_and_billing)
