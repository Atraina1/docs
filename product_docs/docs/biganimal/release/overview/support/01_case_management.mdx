## Viewing your support cases

After you create your support case, you can view the case, the case history, and monitor the status of your case at the [My activities](https://support.biganimal.com/hc/en-us/requests) page in the [Support portal](https://support.biganimal.com/hc/en-us). To find **My Activities**, click on the user's image in the top right corner of the Support portal, and then select **My Activities** from the drop down menu.

If your login account has your email address or you submit the case by email or support web widget, you will receive the case information by email. There is a case request number shown at the email title.

A case can have one of the following statuses: 
-   **Open:** The new case or reopened case status.
-   **Awaiting your reply:** The support agent responds to your case to ask for more information, or let you know the problem is solved and ask you to confirm.
-   **Resolved:** The case is resolved. 

## Updating your support cases

You can update your case at the bottom of the request page in the **Add to conversation** box. When EDB BigAnimal support updates the case, you can view the case update at the request page. 

If your login account has your email address or you submit the case by email or support web widget, you can update the case or receive the case update from support by email.

## Searching for support cases

From the **My requests** list at the [My activities](https://support.biganimal.com/hc/en-us/requests) page in the [Support portal](https://support.biganimal.com/hc/en-us), you can search for all of your support cases by the keyword in the search bar. You can also filter the cases by **Status**.

## Reopening support case

You can reopen the case after it has been set to **Solved** just by responding back and adding a new comment. You can reopen your support case up to 7 Calendar days from when your issue was resolved. 

If your login account has your email address or you submit the case by email or support web widget, you can reopen the case by replying to the last email of the case, except the survey email.

Support cases that have been in the resolved state for more than 7 Calendar days can not be reopened. However, you can create a follow-up from the original case. To create a follow-up, click the link at the bottom of the case. The follow-up will create a new case which links with the original case.

## Resolving a support case

You can resolve the case by adding a new comment and clicking **Mark as solved**. Our support team will resolve the case for you when the issue is marked as solved and they receive your confirmation. 

## Case survey

The EDB BigAnimal support team asks that you provide feedback on your experience by completing the survey on the request page. The survey will be available one day after the case is solved. You can provide ratings and comments in the survey until six days later.

If your login account has your email address or you submit the case by email or support web widget, you will receive the survey email and you can click the survey link at the email to submit a survey.

Our support team appreciates your feedback, and reviews the survey results to improve the support experience.
