title: Handling BigAnimal updates
---
EDB regularly pushes updates including bug fixes as well as releases of additional functionality. 
EDB notifies you about updates in a banner on the BigAnimal portal. Details are available on the [BigAnimal status page](https://status.biganimal.com/). You can subscribe to get these updates in a feed by selecting **Subscribe to Updates** on the status page.

These updates may cause transient outages that in some cases may cause clusters to go down. If that happens, the outage should be for a minute or less but it is your responsibility to restart the clusters. These outages are not counted toward the minimum connectivity commitments in the service level agreements.

To minimize the time your applications are affected by outages, your application needs to be aware of temporary outages and reconnect after those transient outages are over.
