title: Periodic maintenance

EDB performs periodic maintenance to ensure stability and security of your clusters. EDB performs minor version upgrades and patch updates as part of this periodic maintenance. You are notified in the BigAnimal portal prior to maintenance occurring. Details are available on the [BigAnimal status page](https://status.biganimal.com/). You can subscribe to get these updates in a feed by selecting **Subscribe to Updates** on the status page. 

EDB reserves the right to upgrade customers to the latest minor version without prior notice in an extraordinary circumstance. You cannot configure minor versions. 

These updates may cause transient outages that in some cases may cause clusters to go down. If that happens, the outage should be for a minute or less but it is your responsibility to restart the clusters. These outages are not counted toward the minimum connectivity commitments in the service level agreements.

## Handling BigAnimal update outages

To minimize the time your applications are affected by outages, your application needs to be aware of temporary outages and reconnect after those transient outages are over.
