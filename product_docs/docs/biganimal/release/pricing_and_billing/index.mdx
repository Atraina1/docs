title: "Pricing and billing "
---

Billing is handled by Microsoft Azure. You view BigAnimal invoices and infrastructure usage through Microsoft Azure.

## Pricing
Pricing is based on the number of virtual central processing units (vCPUs) provisioned for the database software offering. Consumption of vCPUs is metered hourly. A deployment is made up of either one instance or one primary and two replica instances of either PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server. When high availability is enabled, multiply the number of vCPUs per instance by three to calculate the full price for all resources used. The table shows the cost breakdown:

| Database type         | Hourly price   | Monthly price\* |
| --------------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| PostgreSQL            | $0.1655 / vCPU | $120.82 / vCPU |
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server | $0.2397 / vCPU | $174.98 / vCPU |

\* The monthly cost is approximate and assumes 730 hours in a month. Microsoft bills on actual hours in a given month. 

## Billing
All billing is handled directly by Microsoft Azure. You can view invoices and usage on the Azure Portal billing page. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/).

## Cloud infrastructure costs
EDB doesn't bill you for cloud infrastructure such as compute, storage, data transfer, monitoring, and logging. BigAnimal clusters run in your Microsoft Azure account. Azure bills you directly for the cloud infrastructure provisioned according to the terms of your account agreement. You can view invoices and usage on the Azure Portal billing page.
