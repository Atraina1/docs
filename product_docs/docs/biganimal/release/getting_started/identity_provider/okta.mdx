  - Have one of the following roles in Okta:

    - Super Administrator

  [Learn more](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/Content/Topics/Security/administrators-learn-about-admins.htm) about Okta administrator roles.

- Unique URL and access code provided in an email from cloudcare@enterprisedb.com. Contact cloudcare@enterprisedb.com if you have not received the email. The URL becomes invalid once you have set up your identity provider with BigAnimal. If you experience any issues with the code or identity provider set up, contact [Support](/biganimal/release/overview/support).
