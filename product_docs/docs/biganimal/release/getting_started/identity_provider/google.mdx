## Prerequisites

- To connect BigAnimal to Google's identity provider, you must have the [Super Administrator](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2405986#super_admin) in Google.

- Unique URL and access code are provided in an email from cloudcare@enterprisedb.com. Contact [cloudcare@enterprisedb.com](mailto:cloudcare@enterprisedb.com) if you don't receive the email. The URL becomes invalid after you set up your identity provider with BigAnimal. If you have issues with the code or identity provider setup, contact [Support](/biganimal/release/overview/support).
