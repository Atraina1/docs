You can connect BigAnimal to your own Azure subscription or AWS account, and enable BigAnimal to deploy and manage your clusters in the cloud. 

To connect to your cloud account EDB provides a command that automatically runs scripts to:
 
 1. Ensure that your cloud account is prepared to meet your clusters' requirements and resource limits.
 
 1. Set up and connect to your cloud account

## Setting up your cloud service provider

Set up your cloud account before you connecting it to BigAnimal. The setup that you perform ensures that your AWS account or Azure subscription is prepared to meet your clusters' requirements and resource limits.

**Prerequisites**:

Before setting up your cloud account, ensure that:

 - *(For connecting to an AWS account)* You are assigned the following AWS managed policies (or an equivalent custom policy granting full access to resources):
    - `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/IAMFullAccess`
    - `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ServiceQuotasFullAccess`
    
 - *(For connecting to an Azure subscription)* You are assigned either of the following roles in Azure AD:
    - Global Administrator
    - Privileged Role Administrator

 - In [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) or [AWS Cloud Shell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell), your environment is running the following: 
      - bash shell version 4.0 or above 
      - [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) JSON parser.
      - BigAnimal CLI version 1.4 or above. For detailed steps, see [Installing the CLI](../../reference/cli/#installing-the-cli).

 - The BigAnimal login user running the CLI is assigned either the `owner` or the `contributor` role.
   
Perform the following steps:

1. Open the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) or the [AWS Cloud Shell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell) in your browser. 

1. Login to BigAnimal with following command, the user must be assigned either the `owner` or the `contributor` role.
   
   ```
   biganimal create-credential --name <UserLogin> --address portal.biganimal.com --port 443
   ```

1. Run the following command:
   
    ```
    biganimal setup-csp --provider <cloud-service-provider> --subscription-id <target-subscription> --region <region> [options]
    ```
   
    The required arguments are:

    | Argument | Description |
    | -------- | ----------- |
    | &lt;target-subscription&gt; | Azure subscription ID of your BigAnimal deployment. |
    | &lt;region&gt; | Azure region where your clusters are being deployed. See [Supported regions](../../overview/03a_region_support) for a list of possible regions. |
    
    Possible options are:

    | Options | Description |
    | ------- | ----------- |
    | `-h` or `--help`| Displays the command help. |
    | `-i` or `--instance-type` | Azure VM or AWS instance type instance type for the BigAnimal cluster. The help command provides a list of possible VM instance types. Choose the instance type that best suits your application and workload. |
    | `-a` or `--high-availability` | Enables high availability for the cluster. See [Supported architectures](../../overview/02_high_availability) for more information.|
    | `-e` or `--endpoint` | Type of network endpoint for the BigAnimal cluster, either `public` or `private`. See [Cluster networking architecture](../creating_a_cluster/01_cluster_networking) for more information. |
    | `-r` or `--activate-region` | Specifies region activation if no clusters currently exist in the region. |
    | `--onboard` | Checks if the user and subscription are correctly configured. | 
    | `--run` | Runs the command in *automatic* mode. If this option is not included, the command generates two bash scripts `ba-csp-preflight` and `ba-csp-setup`, which you must then run individually. |
        
    
1. The command checks for cloud account readiness and displays the results on your screen. To troubleshoot requirements that are not met, see [Preparing your Azure subscription](../preparing_cloud_account/01_preparing_azure/#configure-your-azure-subscription) or [Preparing your AWS account](../preparing_cloud_account/02_preparing_aws/#configure-your-aws-account). 

	
1. If the cloud readiness checks pass successfully, your cloud account is successfully set up. Connect your cloud account to BigAnimal with following command. For example to connect to Azure:
   ```
   biganimal connect-csp --provider azure
   ```
!!! Tip
     Alternatively, you can enable the CLI interactive mode by running the `biganimal config set interactive_mode on` command then running the `biganimal setup-csp`. The CLI prompts you to enter options in a step-by-step manner.
