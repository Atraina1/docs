You can connect BigAnimal to your own Azure subscription or AWS account and enable BigAnimal to deploy and manage your clusters in the cloud. 

To connect to your cloud account, EDB provides a command that:
 
 1. Ensures your cloud account is prepared to meet your clusters' requirements and resource limits.
 
 1. Sets up and connects to your cloud account.

## Setting up your cloud service provider

Set up your cloud account before connecting it to BigAnimal. The setup that you perform ensures that your AWS account or Azure subscription is prepared to meet your clusters' requirements and resource limits.

**Prerequisites**:

Before setting up your cloud account, ensure that:

 - **If connecting to an AWS account:** 

   You are assigned the following AWS managed policies (or an equivalent custom policy granting full access to resources):

    - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/IAMFullAccess

    - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ServiceQuotasFullAccess
    
 - **If connecting to an Azure subscription:** 
 
   You are assigned either of the following roles in Azure AD:

    - Global Administrator

    - Privileged Role Administrator

 - In [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) or [AWS Cloud Shell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell), your environment is running: 

      - bash shell version 4.0 or above. 

      - [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) JSON parser.
      - BigAnimal CLI version 1.4 or later. For detailed steps, see [Installing the CLI](../../reference/cli/#installing-the-cli).

 - The BigAnimal login user running the CLI is assigned either the owner or the contributor role.
   
Perform the following steps:

1. Open the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) or the [AWS Cloud Shell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell) in your browser. 

1. Log in to BigAnimal with the following command, the user must be assigned either the owner or the contributor role.
   
   ```
   biganimal create-credential --name <UserLogin> --address portal.biganimal.com --port 443
   ```

1. Run the following command to set up your cloud provider:
   
    ```
    biganimal setup-csp --provider <cloud-service-provider> --subscription-id <target-subscription> --region <region> [options]
    ```
   
    For more information on the command arguments, run the following command:

    ```
    biganimal setup-csp --help
    ```        
   !!! Tip
     Alternatively, you can enable the CLI interactive mode by running:
     ```
     biganimal config set interactive_mode on
     biganimal setup-csp
     ```
     The CLI prompts you to enter options in a step-by-step manner. 
1. The command checks for cloud account readiness and displays the results. If requirements are not met, see [Preparing your Azure subscription](../preparing_cloud_account/01_preparing_azure/#configure-your-azure-subscription) or [Preparing your AWS account](../preparing_cloud_account/02_preparing_aws/#configure-your-aws-account) for more information. 

	
1. If the cloud readiness checks pass, your cloud account is successfully set up. Connect your cloud account to BigAnimal with following command. 
   ```
   biganimal connect-csp --provider  <cloud-service-provider> 
   ```
