EDB provides a CLI command that checks whether requirements and resource limits are met in your cloud before connecting to BigAnimal. An account owner or contributor can run this command.

!!! Note
    
    In order to run CLI commands for your AWS account, you must have the following AWS managed policies assigned (or an equivalent custom policy granting full access to resources):
    
    - `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/IAMFullAccess`
    - `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ServiceQuotasFullAccess`
    
    To run CLI commands for your Azure account, you must have one of the following roles in Azure AD:

    -   Global Administrator
    -   Privileged Role Administrator

    or you need the cooperation of a user with one of those roles in your organization.

## Setting up your cloud server provider

1. Log into BigAnimal.

1. On the Cloud Providers page in BigAnimal, select **Download BigAnimal CLI**.

1. Run the following command:

   ```
  setup-csp --provider 
          {--account-id | --subscription-id}
          --region
          [--instance-type --high-availability --networking | --skip-preflight]
          [--run]
          [--credential]
   ```

1. Input your cloud provider and account ID (if using AWS) or subscription ID (if using Azure). The CLI sets up the boundary policy, designates the role and access BigAnimal should have to your cloud provider, and checks and raises account limits as needed.
