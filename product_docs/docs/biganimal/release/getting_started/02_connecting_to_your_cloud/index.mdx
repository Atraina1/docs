How you connect your cloud to BigAnimal depends on if you purchased BigAnimal from Azure Marketplace or if you purchased directly from EDB and are using your own cloud account to link to BigAnimal. 

Regardless of how you connect to BigAnimal, you must first set up your cloud account to ensure its readiness to work with BigAnimal, as follows: 

## Meet your clusters' requirements and resource limits
   
Perform configurations to ensure that your cloud is prepared to meet your clusters' requirements and resource limits, such as
-   *If connecting to Azure*:
 -   Are the necessary Azure resource providers registered for your subscription?
 -   Is there a restriction on SKUs for the standard Esv3 family and standard D2_v4 VM size?
 -   Is there a sufficient limit on the number of vCPU or public IP addresses in your region?
-   *If connecting to AWS*:
 -   Is the AWS CLI configured to access your AWS account?
 -   Is there a sufficient limit on the number of vCPUs and Network Load Balancers (NLBs) left in your region?

## Allow BigAnimal to perform maintenance operations
 
Create and assign a role to BigAnimal with sufficient permissions to deploy and maintain your clusters. For example in AWS, BigAnimal uses the role EDBOperations set with * as *policy/trust* and *policy/policy* , to perform maintenance operations in your AWS account withouth any need for credentials stored at the customer side. The trust policy of the EDBOperations role trusts the EDBIAM AWS Account. This allows EDBIAM users to assume that particular role in the customer's AWS account.

Depending on how you purchased BigAnimal, see the following sections for steps on setting up and connecting your cloud.
