EDB provides commands to set up and connect to your cloud.

## Set up your cloud

Before connecting your cloud to BigAnimal, we check for the readiness of your cloud account and provide necessary permissions. The set up is automatically done when you execute EDB's commands, see [Connect to your cloud](#onnect-to-your-cloud).

!!! Important
    You do not need to manually set up your cloud. However you might need to increase resource limits or manually perform configurations in your cloud, if either of the readiness checks are not met.

### Check for the readiness of your cloud account

You might need to manually increase resource limits or perform configurations in your cloud, if either of the following readiness checks are not met: 

* **If connecting to Azure**:
   - Are the necessary Azure resource providers registered for your subscription?
   - Is there a restriction on SKUs for the standard Esv3 family and standard D2_v4 VM size?
   - Is the limit on the number of vCPU and public IP addresses in your region sufficient for your clusters?
* **If connecting to AWS**:
   - Is the AWS CLI configured to access your AWS account?
   - Is the limit on the number of vCPUs and Network Load Balancers (NLBs) in your region sufficient for your clusters?
 

### Grant permissions to perform maintenance operations
 
We create and assign a role to BigAnimal with sufficient permissions to deploy and maintain clusters in your cloud. 

In AWS, for example, BigAnimal uses the role EDBOperations with *policy/trust* and *policy/policy* boundaries set to *. The trust policy of the EDBOperations role trusts the EDBIAM AWS Account, and allows EDBIAM users to assume that particular role in the customer's AWS account. BigAnimal does have access to any customer credentials while connecting to your cloud.

## Connect your cloud

How you connect your cloud to BigAnimal depends on if you purchased BigAnimal from the Azure Marketplace or if you purchased directly from EDB and are connecting your own cloud account.
