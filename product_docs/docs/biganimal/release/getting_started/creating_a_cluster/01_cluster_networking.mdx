title: Cluster networking architecture
---

BigAnimal clusters can be exposed to client applications in two ways:

-   Public — The cluster is available on the Internet.
-   Private — In a private cluster, the IP address or DNS name is private to the VNet or VPC hosting your BigAnimal services. By default, it is not routable from other networks. See [Setting up Azure infrastructure to connect to a private network cluster](../../using_cluster/02_connecting_your_cluster/#setting-up-azure-infrastructure-to-connect-to-a-private-network-cluster) for details and instructions on how to properly configure routing for private clusters.

<!-- Need to change the above link to the parent topic of connecting to your clusters -->

## Basic architecture

BigAnimal deploys a dedicated virtual network (VNet) in Azure or an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS to host clusters and their supporting management services. This VNet or VPC is named after the region where the cluster is deployed. 
In Azure, for example, if the cluster is deployed in the East US region, it is named `vnet-eastus`.


## Public cluster load balancing

When a cluster is created with public network access, an Azure
Standard SKU Load Balancer is created and configured with a public IP
address that always routes to the leader of your cluster. Once
assigned, this IP address does not change unless you change the
networking configuration for your cluster.

Only one Azure Load Balancer per BigAnimal region is typically deployed in your Azure
subscription. Subsequent public clusters add more
IP addresses to the existing load balancer.

## Private cluster load balancing

When a cluster is created with private network access, an Azure
Standard SKU Load Balancer is created and configured with an IP
address that always routes to the leader of your cluster. Once
assigned, this IP address does not change unless you change the
networking configuration for your cluster.

This IP address is private to the VNet hosting your BigAnimal
services. By default it is not routable from other networks, even in
your Azure account. See [Setting up Azure infrastructure to connect to a private network cluster](../../using_cluster/02_connecting_your_cluster/#setting-up-azure-infrastructure-to-connect-to-a-private-network-cluster) for details and instructions
on how to properly configure routing for private clusters.

Only one Azure Internal Load Balancer per BigAnimal region is typically deployed in your
Azure subscription. Subsequent private clusters add more IP addresses to the existing load balancer.

## DNS

Every BigAnimal cluster, regardless of public or private networking
status, is assigned a single DNS zone that maps to its exposed IP
address, either public or private. When toggling between public and
private, wait up to 120 seconds for DNS caches to flush.
