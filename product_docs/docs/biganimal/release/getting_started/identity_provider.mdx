navTitle: Setting up your identity provider
---

To access BigAnimal for the first time, you have to set up your identity provider (IDP). After setting up your identity provider, you can add users to BigAnimal by adding them to the designated group in your identity provider. Once you've logged into BigAnimal using your identity provider, you can set up your cloud service provider (CSP) in the BigAnimal portal to complete onboarding. If you purchased through Azure Marketplace, BigAnimal authenticates users using Azure Active Directory (AD) and you do not have to complete these steps as Azure AD is linked during subscription. 

BigAnimal supports Single-Sign On through SAML identity providers. The SAML application enables access to BigAnimal for groups selected within your identity provider. You configure your SAML application to send a SAML assertion response to BigAnimal for each user.

The identity provider application provides:
- signature certificate
- single sign-on URL (login URL)

The BigAnimal service provider provides:
- ACS URL (Assertion Consumer Service)
- SP Entity ID (Audience URI)

The Set Up Identity Provider page in BigAnimal provides the ACS URL and Audience URI, which you can copy to use when configuring your SAML application. The page also includes information about mandatory attributes for the configuration.

The following SAML assertions are needed to map the user information in your identity provider application to BigAnimal:

```
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/surname
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress
```

The actual mappings vary across different identity providers. For example, if you are using Azure AD, you can map a user's user principal name (UPN) to the `emailaddress` assertion. That user can then sign in to BigAnimal using their UPN instead of their email address.

## Configure SAML

On the Set Up Identity Provider page:

1. On the **Connection Info** tab, copy the following URLs to use in your identity provider configuration:  
   
   | URL                            | Description |
   | ------------------------------ | ----------- |
   | Assertion Consumer Service URL | BigAnimal specific URL to which SAML assertions from your identity provider are sent. |
   | Audience URI                   | The entity or audience for which the SAML assertion is intended. |

1. Configure your identity provider to send the SAML response. The SAML response must include the following attributes:
   - `givenname`: BigAnimal uses the value as the given name in the profile of the authenticated user.
   - `surname`: BigAnimal uses the value as the surname in the profile of the authenticated user.
   
   - `emailaddress`: BigAnimal uses the value for the email address in the profile of the authenticated user. 
   
   Provide an `NameID` element within the `Subject` element. Provide your email ID as the value to `NameID`. BigAnimal uses the email ID you provide as your username and primary email.
      
     For example:

1. On the **Setup Configuration** tab, enter the configuration information for your preferred SAML identity provider:

   | Field | Description |
   | ----- | ----------- |
   | Issuer URL | URL string uniquely associated with your identity provider partner. |
   | Single Sign-On URL | The identity provider's sign-on URL. |
   | Identity provider signature certificate | Identity provider's assertion signing certificate (.cer or .cert). Coordinate with your identity provider partner to obtain this certificate securely. |
   | Request Binding | SAML Authentication Request Protocol binding used to send the authentication request: HTTP-Redirect,  HTTP-Post, or Hybrid (SAML request is REDIRECT and response is POST). |
   | Response Signature Algorithm (RSA) Algorithm | The signature algorithm used to sign the SAML AuthNRequest (RSA SHA-1 or RSA SHA-256). |
 
1. Select **Test Connection**. If you connect to your identity provider successfully, you are brought to the your identity provider's log in screen. If not, an error message displays and you should contact [Support](../overview/support). 

Once your identity provider is set up, you can view your connection status, ID, login URL, audience URI, and assertion consumer service URL from the BigAnimal portal on the **Admin > Identity Provider** page.

## Manage roles for added users

You add users through your identity provider. A user who is added in the identity provider is automatically added to BigAnimal. BigAnimal assigns them with the default role of reader. You manage roles and permissions from BigAnimal, see [Managing portal access](../../administering_cluster/01_portal_access/). 

!!! Note
    
    A user is only created in BigAnimal once they have logged in. Once they have logged in, their BigAnimal role can be changed.
