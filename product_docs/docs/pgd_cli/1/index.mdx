The EDB Postgres Distributed Command Line Interface (PGD CLI) is a tool to manage your BDR cluster. It allows you to run commands against BDR clusters. 

You can use it to inspect and manage cluster resources and to get information on the following:

-   node summary
-   BDR/Postgres version on each node
-   replication and subscription details
-   membership and worker events
-   raft consensus details
-   CAMO (Commit at Most Once) details
-   clock skew
-   cluster health summary
