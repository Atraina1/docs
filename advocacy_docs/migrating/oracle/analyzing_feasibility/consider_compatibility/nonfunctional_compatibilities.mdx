## High availability 

Mission-critical workloads must remain operational at all times and have little tolerance for even planned downtime for maintenance. This demand for high availability requires solutions that provide:
High-speed replication and redundancy to eliminate single points of failure in the system
Failure detection and automated failover to ensure systems continue to function in the event of a breakdown in the system
Data and system recovery to assist DBAs following failure events

## Performance and scalability 

You can optimize database operations through various means to deliver higher performance. Connection pooling, for example, refers to a common way of maintaining open connections to the database for applications that repeatedly make requests as opposed to having to create new connections each time. Data replication can increase performance by making information simultaneously available to multiple end-user applications. You can achieve these performance enhancements through database enhancements and various external complementary solutions.

## Integration 

Today’s data centers commonly consist of one or more relational and many nonrelational database solutions deployed to handle specific workloads based on data type and application. Relational databases use a range of mechanisms for connecting to other like and dissimilar database solutions across the infrastructure to connect data from multiple sources and create a cohesive data fabric. In some cases, the database is engineered with specific capabilities that enhance data integration. Database vendors also develop adaptors that enable their database to connect with other vendor solutions.

\*It's possible, and often useful, to have some transactions commit synchronously and others asynchronously depending on the session connected to the database. 

## Management 

Large enterprises have large database deployments often into the hundreds and beyond. DBAs require tools for maintaining these data farms easily and quickly and for performing operations in bulk across multiple databases. Customizable graphical consoles with a full complement of features for monitoring, tuning, managing, and alerting are critical to DBAs performing the basics of their responsibilities. Management encompasses both the capabilities in the database that support the DBA in their operational tasks and tools external to the database.
