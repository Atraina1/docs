title: "Application development"
---

Databases are a foundation of today’s data-driven enterprise, and applications are increasingly data intensive. Vendors in turn work to continually enhance their database solutions to support the needs of application developers who seek the flexibility to make choices and simple ways for executing complex tasks. For example, databases that can provide support for multiple server-side languages for triggers, functions, and stored procedures give developers the option to choose their language for both client, middle-tier, and database server programming. Object-oriented capabilities like user-defined object types allow the database to store real-world representations of data, thus making development easier, quicker, and more understandable.
