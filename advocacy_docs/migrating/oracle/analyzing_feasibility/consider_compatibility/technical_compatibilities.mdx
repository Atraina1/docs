title: Technical compatibilities with Oracle Enterprise
---

To assess the feasibility of your migration, look at the tables that follow to understand how the elements you want to migrate are handled in an Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server migration.

## Tables legend 

The tables use these words or symbols to denote compatibility:

Yes/No — Denotes whether the feature or characteristic is supported in the database. 

✓ — The feature operates in a manner compatible with Oracle, allowing users to continue using or migrate their existing Oracle skills, program code, or data. 


##  Tables and partitioning

The range of constructs in the database and how much flexibility DBAs have in organizing these structures can affect performance as well as maintenance and other operational requirements. The ability to partition a database improves performance, for example. Organizing data into distinct structures and distributing them across the infrastructure also improves manageability, availability, and load balancing. Materialized views allow DBAs to replace slow, resource-intensive runtime queries, complex joins, or lengthy scans of data with simple, faster reads from pre-joined, presorted, and stored results.

## Data types 

Data types provide ways for a DBMS to define, implement, and use information in the system and put constraints on how data is interpreted by the database when multiple data types are in use. EDB Postgres Advanced Server has strong compatibility with Oracle data types and is highly extensible, allowing it to quickly support new and emerging data types and workloads as they become popular. 

| Data types           | Oracle Enterprise           | EDB Postgres Advanced Server   |
|—---------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|

## Indexes 

To provide optimal performance for the wide range of supported data types and new workloads utilizing those data types, the database must also support a wide variety of indexes. EDB Postgres Advanced Server is somewhat unique in this regard, especially its GiST index, which allows for easy development of specialized indexes for new data types.

## SQL capabilities 

EDB Postgres Advanced Server strongly conforms to the ANSI-SQL:2008 standard. It also has transactional DDL which supports backing out even large changes to DDL, such as table creation. While you can’t recover from an add/drop on a database or tablespace, all other catalog operations are reversible. This feature is often used for protection when doing complicated work like schema upgrades. If you put all such changes into a transaction block, you can make sure they all apply atomically or not at all. This lowers the possibility that the database will be corrupted by a typographic or other such error in the schema change, which is particularly important when you’re modifying multiple related tables where a mistake might destroy the relational key.

## SQL extensions 

Oracle has a number of SQL extensions that are popular with Oracle users. While not standard to the SQL language, they provide utility and convenience to DBAs and developers. EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports the ones that EDB customers ask for most often.
