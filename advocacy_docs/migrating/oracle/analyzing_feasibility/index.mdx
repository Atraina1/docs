In this phase of the migration journey, you need to:

-  Determine the platform for the migration, for example, private cloud or public cloud.
-  Understand the compatibility between the source and target databases to ensure that the elements you need are available.
-  Understand the workarounds available for compatibilitiy issues. See the [Migration Portal wiki](https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/migration-free-tool-migrating-oracle-postgresql) for details. (You must register and log in to Migration Portal to access the wiki.)
