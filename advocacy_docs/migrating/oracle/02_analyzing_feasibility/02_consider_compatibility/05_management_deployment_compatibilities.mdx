## Management 

Large enterprises have large database deployments often into the hundreds and beyond. DBAs require tools for maintaining these data farms easily and quickly and for performing operations in bulk across multiple databases. Customizable graphical consoles with a full complement of features for monitoring, tuning, managing, and alerting are critical to DBAs performing the basics of their responsibilities. Management encompasses both the capabilities in the database that support the DBA in their operational tasks and tools external to the database.
