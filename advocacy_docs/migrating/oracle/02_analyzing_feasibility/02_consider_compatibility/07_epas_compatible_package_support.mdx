| DBMS_ALERT     | Functions that allow asynchronous notification of database events via an Alert. Using this package and triggers, an application can notify itself whenever values of interest in the database are changed. |
| DBMS_AQ        | Database-integrated asynchronous message queuing provides a flexible mechanism for integrating applications across the enterprise by communicating activities and exchanging a variety of information payloads. |

| DBMS_PIPE      | Functions that allow two or more sessions in the same database instance to communicate with one another. |
| DBMS_PROFILER  | Provides functions to profile stored procedure workloads and identify performance bottlenecks. |
| DBMS_SCHEDULER | Job scheduler functions for creating and executing unattended repetitive tasks inside the database. |
| DBMS_SQL       | Permits the use of dynamic SQL in procedures to allow applications to run SQL statements with unknown parameters (such as table name) until runtime. |
| DBMS_RANDOM    | Useful functions to generate random text, numeric and date values. | 
| DBMS_REDACT    | Redaction prevents a user from seeing all or portions of sensitive data. | 
| DBMS_RLS       | Implements row level security functions in the database blocking users from seeing each other’s data in the same application.| 
| DBMS_SESSION   | Functions with the ability to enable and disable roles. |
| DBMS_UTILITY   | A collection of functions for getting information about various runtime operations and meta data from the database. |
| UTL_ENCODE     | Functions to perform Base64 encoding and decoding of data intended for transport between hosts. |
| UTL_FILE       | Allows database procedures to read and write operating system text files in an I/O stream fashion. |
| UTL_HTTP       | Functions that provide the ability to make HTTP calls to access information on web servers. |
| UTL_MAIL       | Provides functions to create, manage, and send email from the database including attachments, CC, and BCC. |
