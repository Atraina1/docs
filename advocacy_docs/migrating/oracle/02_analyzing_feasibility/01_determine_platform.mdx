title: “Determine the platform”

When migrating databases to the cloud, you have several options:			

-  Private cloud, such as OpenShift, Nutanix, or VMWare	
-  Public cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS), such as AWS EC2 or GCP
-  Public cloud Kubernetes Platforms, such GKE, AKS, or EKS
-  Public cloud database as a service (DBaaS), such as RDS Postgres, Aurora for Postgres, Azure Database for Postgres, Google’s Cloud SQL for Postgres, or EDB’s Cloud BigAnimal
 							
While they all implement the Postgres API, there are key differences in migration capabilities.
 							
EDB’s native compatibility with Oracle is available on OpenShift, VMWare, all IaaS and K8s platforms, and on EDB’s BigAnimal. RDS, Aurora, Azure Database for Postgres, Google’s Cloud SQL for Postgres are limited to the translation approach.
 							
From a nonfunctional perspective, IaaS, VMWare, OpenShift and K8s platforms provide the highest level of control for performance, manageability, and integration, but they also require in-house deployment and management resources. Leading DBaaS platforms address these issues, but they limit configurability for nonfunctional requirements.

When selecting a cloud platform, think about your future needs. Initial migrations might be served well by a DBaaS provided by a cloud service provider such as AWS or Azure, for whom Postgres is just another software platform that they operate. More advanced applications might need greater access to tuning parameters, as provided on IaaS platforms or the services of a Postgres specialist such as EDB.
