Migrating your database consists of a nine-step “journey.”

![Migration journey](images/journey.png)

## 1. Decide to migrate

First, your organization must make the decision to migrate. You might decide you're spending too much money on your legacy database system. You might have initiatives that your current database technology doesn't support well. Or maybe you want to move to the cloud or take advantage of open source software. These are common factors that may lead to your business case for migrating.

Once you have your business case and your organization buys into it, your organization must commit to performing the migration. Commitment includes funding and resources to perform the migration.

## 2. Analyze feasibility and alternatives

Analyze your alternatives and look at the feasibility of migrating to certain databases. You'll want to:

-  Review your application portfolio to determine whether all of your applications will migrate. As part of this review, you'll look at which applications have legacy databases that you can and want to migrate from. Align your migration priorities with IT strategies to ensure these are important enough business applications to consider for migration.  As part of reviewing your application portfolio you may decide that some applications can simply be retired. There may be other applications in your porfolio that you may desire to migrate but canot because they are only supported on the existing database. As you are identifying a candidate set of applications to migrate, keep in mind that the desire to migrate them must correspond to an organizational commitment to completing the migration. It will take time, resources, and budget. 
-  Evaluate which database technologies will be the right choice as the migration target for each of your applications.  In many cases, EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) will be an ideal choice to replace Oracle; however, some applications will have requirements that might be better addressed by other solutions.  After selecting the appropriate set of target database technologies, a follow on step is te perform a more detailed assessment of how complex the migration will likely be.  When EPAS has been chosen as a potential target, the EDB Migration Portal can be used to assesss how compatiblle the Oracle schema and procedural objects in the database are with EPAS.  This information will be important in the next step of the journey.
-  If you are considering a migation of a large estate of applications, perform a first level pass at identifying the applications you would like to move first.  Are some so important that there would be more risk in moving them? You will also want to look at the difficulty of the migrations and prioritize them based on that. 
-  Decide what hosting environment you will be targeting for your migration.  See [Infrastructure considerations](factors_to_consider/#infrastructure-considerations) for more information about the options you have for hosting EPAS database. Are you currently running on premises? Do you want to stay on-premises or move to cloud? Or are you on the cloud and perhaps that has not worked out and you need to move back to on-premises or to another cloud provider?
-  Although you will perform a more thorough review of solutions to address specific compatility issues that are encountered later in the journey, it's also important to identify potential migration problems in this early stage of the journey. For an Oracle-to-EDB Postgres Advanced Server migration, see the [Consider compatibility issues](consider_compatibility) for details.

## 3. Plan the migration

Planning your migration involves these processes:

-  Prioritize applications. Once you've decided on the applications to migrate, prioritize the order in which you will migrate them. Organizations often consider selecting the most difficult because ones they believe that if they can do the most difficult migration, then all the other ones will be easier. However, we usually recommend picking one that is moderately important to you&mdash;not necessarily the most valuable to customers&mdash;and also not the most difficult. This way you can learn from the process. Then select the next ones based on what you learned from that first migration and so on until you eventually get to the most valuable and most difficult.
-  Define nonfunctional requirements, such as performance and availability.
-  Design the solution at a high level. For example, select the database, the platform, the type of migration, your high-availability requirements, and so on.
-  Estimate effort. Out of your analysis comes a sense of how much time and resources are required to do the migrations.
-  Prepare the migration environment. Obtain and install the needed software, and establish connectivity between the servers.

Start the migration process by determining the database objects and data to include in the migration. Form a migration team that includes someone with solid knowledge of the architecture and implementation of the source system.

## 4. Migrate database schema, code, and data

You’ll need to perform these steps to migrate the database:

-  Move the schema. If the migration involves a large body of data, consider migrating the schema definition before moving the data. Verify the results of the DDL migration and resolve any problems reported in the migration summary.
-  Migrate database functionality. This includes the code that exists in the database, such as functions that are called by the application or procedures that that database uses.
-  Migrate data as a snapshot (copy at a particular point in time) or change data capture (CDC). As part of every change data capture process, the initial load is done by some sort of snapshot. You move the data to the target database and, if you have a need for ongoing data migration, then use some change data capture mechanism to identify the changes out of the source database and transfer the changes to the target database.

## 5. Migrate interfaces and application

Convert applications to work with the newly migrated Postgres database. The application is the code external to the database that interacts with the database. 

Migrating the application involves:

-  Migrating APIs (JDBC, ODBC, OCI, .NET, and so on). Applications that use open standard connectivity such as JDBC or ODBC normally require changes only to the database connection strings and selection of the EnterpriseDB driver. See [Connecting an application to Postgres](../migration_toolkit/latest/03_migration_methodology/#connecting_application_postgres) for more information.
-  Converting embedded application SQL. The SQL might have been built to work with the source database. Sometimes there's a specific syntax that Oracle supports that might not be supported in Postgres. In this case, you might need to do some conversion of that SQL so that it works with Postgres.
-  Migrating applications. There might be some movement of the migration&mdash;where it's hosted and its configuration&mdash;that needs to take place along with migrating the source code.

## 6. Migrate reports and management tools

In this phase, you’ll migrate reports, DBA utilities, and scripts. Organizations often have reporting mechanisms and other management tools that query the database. You'll need to update those reports and utilities that interact with the source database so they'll work with your target database.

## 7. Test the migration

Whatever the size of your migration, you’ll need to validate that the migrated application operates the same as the original application. You'll be testing all along, but at some point, you need to do a formal set of tests to:

 -  Confirm the results of the data migration and resolve any problems reported in the migration summary
 -  Ensure that the application is functionally the same
 -  Validate that the performance metrics are acceptable

## 8. Optimize and configure post migration

In this phase, you’ll test the system performance and tune the new server, setting parameters of the database so that it runs optimally. You might need to make changes to the queries that you execute against the database so that it performs better than it would if it was taking a generic query. The application also might have had some Oracle-specific tuning that you might need to tune specifically for Postgres.

This phase is also the time to address your high availability, disaster recovery, and security requirements, as well as how users and applications authenticate to the database and who's authorized to perfom each action.

## 9. Complete cutover/go live

This phase consists of the following:

-  Completion of CDC.
-  Rollback setup. Set up the rollback configuration so that the source database is receiving updates from the target database and it'll be there as a fallback position in case you're not able to complete the migration successfully. This way, you can go back to running the application against the source database. Moving data back to the target database is often done through a change data capture mechanism.
-  Go/no-go. Test the target database and, if you're confident that the application is performing well in the new environment, you'll make a go/no-go decision, 
-  Production cutover. Once you complete the cutover and are satisfied with it, usually you'll remove the fallback position of sending the change data capture back to the target data source database. At that point, you'll run only in the production system.
