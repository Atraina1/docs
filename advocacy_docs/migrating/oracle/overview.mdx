## Factors to consider when migrating

You'll want to think about these factors when analyzing and planning for your migration:

-  Schemas
-  Data
-  Infrastructure
-  Applications
-  Operations

### Schema migration considerations

The schema defines the structure of the database. Schemas include the definition for tables and other structures, like sequences, indexes, constraints, and views. Although the syntax that Postgres provides for creating these objects is often similar or identical to that of Oracle, there are differences that you might need to address when migrating them.

Data types are used in the tables and in the other objects that are used by the database. For a migration, you need to think about how data types in Oracle map to those in Postgres.

A database schema also contains code objects, including packages, procedures, functions, and triggers, that are written directly in the database. In Oracle, code objects are written in Oracle's PL/SQL language.  PostgreSQL has its own built-in programmng lanugage that isn't compatible with Oracle's. However, EDB Postgres Advanced Server does provide a built-in implementation of PL/SQL, known as SPL. Although EDB's SPL covers a large percentage of the most commonly used Oracle PL/SQL constructs, it doesn't implement the full set of Oracle constructs. As a result, some Oracle code objects might need to be converted to work with EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

There are often syntax differences between how the source and target databases interact with the data. Oracle has certain conventions and keywords that it uses in its version of the Structured Query Language (SQL) for selecting, inserting, updating, and deleting information that are not be supported in Postgres that you'll need to be aware of.

### Data migration considerations

While the schema provides the structure, the data is the content of the database. One thing you need to think about is how to move the data to the target database. The method depends on how much data you need to move and how much downtime you can afford. You'll need to decide whether bulk loading is right for you, meaning you'll get a snapshot of data from the source system, transfer it to the target system, and move on from there. Or, you might need to keep the source application and database up and running while migrating the data to the target database. Since the source database is still receiving updates, you want to be able to continue to move that data to the target database.

Fallback is another consideration. As you go through a migration process, you'll eventually complete the migration. As you finalize testing of that migrated system, you'll often want to have a fallback position in case the migration wasn't entirely successful. After beginning operations in the migrated system, you can fall back to the original source database and source application more easily if the legacy database is being kept in synch with data changes being applied in the migrated database. Your fallback plan must ensure that new data entered into the migrated database can make it back into the original source database in a timely manner.

For migrating data, in addition to the corer tools we offer for pushing data from the source database to the target database, you might also use tools to support more advanced data migration scenarios, such as more complex extract-transform-load (ETL) needs. These tools pull the data out of the source database, transform it, and then load it into the database target database. 

Once the data is in the target system, you want to validate that the data that you put in the target system matches the data in the source system.

### Infrustructure considerations

Databases reside on infrastructure, so you'll have to consider the hosting environment for the source database as well as consider what the target environment will be. For instance, if your current database is deployed on-premises you may decide to migrate to another database also running on-premises; however, more and more organizations are considering moving from an on-premises deployment of a database to a cloud-based deployment. If a cloud based deployment is the ultimate goal, you may decide to migrate the database directly from one running on-premises to one running in the cloud or to first migrate the database to one running on-premises and then moving the migrated database to the cloud.  

If migrating to an on-premises database, either as the end state or as a stepping stone to the cloud, you will need to make sure you have the server resources on hand to perform and test the migration and to host the operational database and related tools.  If migrating to the cloud, your needs will be similar, but you will have likely have more flexibility on being able to add and remove servers as needed to support the migration process.

Another factor to consider is that many legacy application databases were deployed on specialized hardware and operating systems.  This could influence the types of tools and  approaches used for a migration given that you will likely be targeting server options.  You will need to make sure the tools you are intending to use can either be deployed on these systems or can access them to retrieve the information to be migrated.

When considering a migration to on-premise resources, the deployment options you have available for EPAS are:
- physical servers
- virtual machines
- Cloud Native Postgres containers in kubernetes
- private cloud instances

Traditionally, databases were installed on physical servers to optimize performance.  Over time, as virtualization technology improved, it became more common for databases to be installed on virtual machines.  In the last few years, containers have begun to emerge as a viable option for database deployments, especially as the industry has more or less standardized on kubernetes as an orchestration framework and database vendor like EDB have deveoped kubernetes operators for deploying and maintaining databases.

For migrations to the cloud, the following are the deployment options for EPAS:
- BigAnimal cluster
- Self-managed EPAS installed on cloud based server instances
- Cloud Native PostgreSQL (CNP)

More and more, organizations are interested in moving to a managed database service (aka, DBaaS) to take advantage of the well documented benefits such a service provides to businesses. BigAnimal is the EDB Postgres DBaaS offering available on the major comercial clouds that provides the option to easily deploy either PostgreSQL or EPAS database clusters. When organizations want to migrate to the cloud, but desire or need more control over maanaging their database instances and the underlying servers, they have the option to install and manage EPAS on their own in cloud based server instances.  EDB's Cloud Native PostgreSQL (CNP) provides the ability to deploy and manage PostgreSQL or EPAS clusters in kubernetes orchestrated containers. Widespread adoption of containers for databases is still in its early stages; however, as applications shift towards microservices, the use of containers for databases is increasing. Kubernetes clusters can be stood up in the cloud.  In fact, the major cloud providers even offer managed kubernetes services. 

When you have different source infrastructure and target infrastructure, consider that you might have optimized your source system based on the infrastructure. When you move to the target system, you might have to do similar optimizations but using a different technique.

### Application migration considerations

An application sends information to the database and retrieves information from the database. Most applications that use a relational database management system (RDBMS) backend, such as Oracle or Postgres, will issue database queries in the Structured Query Language (SQL). The esstential components of the SQL standard have been adopted by all major relational databases; however, each of them have features that deviate from the standard and are different from one another. As such, some conversion of the SQL code embedded in the application code, either statically or dynamically generated, will likely be required as part of the migration efforts.

In addition, applications have usually been tuned and configured to perform well to work with the legacy database system and operating environment. When you move from the old system to the new system, you might have to make some changes to your application to support running well against the new database and operating environment.

### Operational considerations

Migrating a legacy database to new database technology will result in the need to update operational processes and tools to work with the new database.  In the case of migrations of Oracle to Postgres, any Oracle specific tools that are being used will need to be replaced with Postgres specifc tools.  Some of the major operational aspects to consider include high availability, backup and recovery, monitoring and management, security, and encryption.

Also, when legacy databases are running on older specialized hardware and operating systems, a database migration may also require a migration of the underlying host systems to modern platforms and operating systems.  For on-premise migrations, this may result in the need to change your operations and maintenance procedures and tools to work with the new server platforms and operating systems. For migrations to the cloud, some of the operations and maintenance activities will now be handled by the cloud service provider, but others will still be your responsibity.  Likely, those activities will require different tools and procedures than the ones you are currently using.


## Migration techniques

At a high level, a database migration from Oracle to Postgres includes:	

-  Transforming the schema from a Oracle’s extended version of the SQL standard to a Postgres compliant version, which is generally more compliant with standards  
-  Translating Oracle specific data type definitions to Postgres specific ones  
-  Rewriting queries and stored procedures  
-  Copying data  
-  Updating application APIs to use Postgres JDBC, .NET, ODBC drivers, as Oracle has extended the standard protocols with proprietary extensions				
-  Verifying that the migrated database meets all the nonfunctional requirements related to performance, manageability, high availability, and integration with enterprise security requirements. 

You can perform the migration manually or in an automated fashion.

### Manual approach for transforming databases

Executing these transformations manually is expensive and error prone. Except for very small databases without any business logic and extremely simple application logic, this approach would not be practical.

### Automated approaches to database migration 

Two automated approaches are usually employed instead of a pure manual approach: 	

-  The *native compatibility* approach extends one database’s capabilities and creates a native implementation of another database's specific extensions of the SQL standard, including the APIs and protocols. EDB Postgres Advanced Server is an enhanced version of PostgreSQL that offers compatability with Oracle in the following areas:
    - Oracle specific and syntax compatible database object types
    - Oracle specific data types
    - Oracle specific SQL extensions
    - Oracle PL/SQL support as a built-in native procedural language
    - Oracle data dictionary views (i.e., ALL_, DBA_, USER_ views)
    - Oracle built in PL/SQL packages
    - Oracle-like database drivers
    - Oracle work-alike tools for DBAs
  
  Note that EPAS does not fully implement all Oracle specific features in the above areas.  Nevertheless, the compatiblity is extensive and cover many of the most commonly used Oracle constructs.  As a result, the compatibility features that have been implemented makes most migrations off of Oracle easier.
  
-  The *translation* approach uses automated tools to rewrite (or translate) the Oracle definitions, queries and stored procedures from to Postgres compatible versions. The EDB Migration Portal repair handlers use this approach to automaically convert a large number of objects that contain constructs that do not have a compatible implementation in EPAS. The translation approach is the only approach available with open source migration tools and those provided by other vendors to target pure open-source PostgreSQL. However, depending on the number of objects that need to be translated, the time and effort required to get to a pure open-source solution might not be supported by your schedule or resources.

Note that while most migrations are greatly simplified through the combination of these two automation approaches, some objects will usually still remain that will require manual conversion.  Reference the workarounds in the Knowledge Base or call up EDB's Professional Services to help identify solutions for any manual conversions that remain. 

## The database migration “journey”

Migrating your database consists of a nine-step “journey.”

![Migration journey](images/journey.png)

### 1. Decide to migrate

First, your organization must make the decision to migrate. You might decide you're spending too much money on your legacy database system. You might have initiatives that your current database technology doesn't support well. Or maybe you want to move to the cloud or take advantage of open source software. These factors make up your business case.

Once you have your business case and your organization buys into it, your organization must commit to performing the migration. Commitment includes funding and resources.

### 2. Analyze feasibility and alternatives

Analyze your alternatives and look at the feasibility of migrating to certain databases. You'll want to:

-  Review your application portfolio to determine whether all of your applications will migrate. As part of that review, you'll look at which applications have legacy databases that you can and want to migrate from. Align your migration priorities with IT strategies that these are important business applications. The desire to migrate must correspond to an organizational commitment to completing the migration. It will take time, resources, and budget.
-  Which applications do you move first? Are some so important that there would be more risk in moving them? You will also want to look at the difficulty of the migrations and prioritize them based on that. 
-  Determine whether to run your applications in the cloud (and which cloud) or on premises. See [Determine the platform](analyze_feasibility/determine_platform) for more information. Do you move from on-premises to cloud? Or are you on the cloud and perhaps that has not worked out and you need to move back to on-premises?
-  Decide whether to use an open source platform or a proprietary one. A lot of legacy databases are strictly proprietary. However, now you can choose open source databases that provide comprehensive set of features and also perform well.

It's also important to identify potential migration problems. For an Oracle-to-EDB Postgres Advanced Server migration, see the [Analyzing feasibility](analyzing_feasibility) for details.

### 3. Plan migration

Planning your migration involves these processes:

-  Prioritize applications. Once you've decided on the applications to migrate, prioritize the order in which you will migrate them. We often see organizations select the most difficult because they believe that if they can do the most difficult migration, then all the other ones will be easier. However, we usually recommend picking one that is moderately important to you&mdash;not necessarily the most valuable to customers&mdash;and also not the most difficult. This way you can learn from the process. Then select the next ones based on what you learned from that first migration and so on until you eventually get to the most valuable and most difficult.
-  Define nonfunctional requirements, such as performance and availability.
-  Design the solution at a high level. For example, select the database, the platform, the type of migration, your high-availability requirements, and so on.
-  Estimate effort. Out of your analysis comes a sense of how much time and resources are required to do the migrations.
-  Prepare the migration environment. Obtain and install the needed software, and establish connectivity between the servers.

Start the migration process by determining the database objects and data to include in the migration. Form a migration team that includes someone with solid knowledge of the architecture and implementation of the source system.

### 4. Migrate database schema, code, and data

You’ll need to perform these steps to migrate the database:

-  Move the schema. If the migration involves a large body of data, consider migrating the schema definition before moving the data. Verify the results of the DDL migration and resolve any problems reported in the migration summary.
-  Migrate database functionality. This includes the code that exists in the database, such as functions that are called by the application or procedures that that database uses.
-  Migrate data as a snapshot (copy at a particular point in time) or change data capture (CDC). As part of every change data capture process, the initial load is done by some sort of snapshot. You move the data to the target database and, if you have a need for ongoing data migration, then use some change data capture mechanism to identify the changes out of the source database and transfer the changes to the target database.

### 5. Migrate interfaces and application

Convert applications to work with the newly migrated Postgres database. The application is the code external to the database that interacts with the database. 

Migrating the application involves:

-  Migrating APIs (JDBC, ODBC, OCI, .NET, and so on). Applications that use open standard connectivity such as JDBC or ODBC normally require changes only to the database connection strings and selection of the EnterpriseDB driver. See [Connecting an application to Postgres](../migration_toolkit/latest/03_migration_methodology/#connecting_application_postgres) for more information.
-  Converting embedded application SQL. The SQL might have been built to work with the source database. Sometimes there's a specific syntax that Oracle supports that might not be supported in Postgres. In this case, you might need to do some conversion of that SQL so that it works with Postgres.
-  Migrating applications. There might be some movement of the migration&mdash;where it's hosted and its configuration&mdash;that needs to take place along with migrating the source code.

### 6. Migrate reports and management tools

In this phase, you’ll migrate reports, DBA utilities, and scripts. Organizations often have reporting mechanisms and other management tools that query the database. You'll need to update those reports and utilities that interact with the source database so they'll work with your target database.

### 7. Test the migration

Whatever the size of your migration, you’ll need to validate that the migrated application operates the same as the original application. You'll be testing all along, but at some point, you need to do a formal set of tests to:

 -  Confirm the results of the data migration and resolve any problems reported in the migration summary
 -  Ensure that the application is functionally the same
 -  Validate that the performance metrics are acceptable

### 8. Optimize and configure post migration

In this phase, you’ll test the system performance and tune the new server, setting parameters of the database so that it runs optimally. You might need to make changes to the queries that you execute against the database so that it performs better than it would if it was taking a generic query. The application also might have had some Oracle-specific tuning that you might need to tune specifically for Postgres.

This phase is also the time to address your high availability, disaster recovery, and security requirements, as well as how users and applications authenticate to the database and who's authorized to perfom each action.

### 9. Complete cutover/go live

This phase consists of the following:

-  Completion of CDC.
-  Rollback setup. Set up the rollback configuration so that the source database is receiving updates from the target database and it'll be there as a fallback position in case you're not able to complete the migration successfully. This way, you can go back to running the application against the source database. Moving data back to the target database is often done through a change data capture mechanism.
-  Go/no-go. Test the target database and, if you're confident that the application is performing well in the new environment, you'll make a go/no-go decision, 
-  Production cutover. Once you complete the cutover and are satisfied with it, usually you'll remove the fallback position of sending the change data capture back to the target data source database. At that point, you'll run only in the production system.

## EDB tools for each phase of the journey

One advantage of performing the migration from Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server is the experience EDB has in performing these migrations. For each phase, we offer tools and services that make the migration easier. We can also discuss your business requirements and help you with the decision to migrate and which approach works best for you.

### Assess feasibility 

Use these tools and services to assess the feasibility of your migration:

-  Migration Portal. Business logic, mostly stored procedures, is generally seen as a major migration obstacle during manual migrations or when using the translation approach. Migration Portal is EDB’s tool, provided on a public website, that helps you to assess your Oracle data definition language for its ability to migrate to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.  
-  Migration assessment service. We offer a set of migration assessment services that perform a detailed analysis of your database. From that analysis, you'll learn how difficult the migration will be and how much time and effort it will take to perform the database migration.

See [Analyzing feasibility](analyzing_feasibility) for information on compatibility between Oracle and EDB Postgres Advanced Server. 

### Plan migration 

EDB provides services to help you to plan your migration. Our professional services team has packaged services that look at your enterprise architecture and environment to help you understand what your needs are and then design a solution for you. These services include:

-  Migration assessment
-  Enterprise architecture
-  Solution design

### Migrate schema, code, and data 

For migrating the schema, the following EDB tools and services will help:
 
-  EDB Postgres Advanced Server. Compatibility with Oracle simplifies the migration. EDB Postgres Advanced Server compatibility features mean there will be fewer things to convert because things that worked in Oracle will work in EDB Postgres Advanced Server.
-  Migration Portal. In addition to providing assessment reports, the Migration Portal can convert an Oracle schema to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server-compatible version and has features to help load that schema into an EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance.
-  Migration Toolkit\*. Migration Toolkit helps with migrating database objects and data to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database from Oracle. 
-  Replication Server. EDB Postgres Replication Server provides a robust data platform that replicates from non-PostgreSQL databases to PostgreSQL in single-master mode. You can use it as an alternative to Migration Toolkit for migrating data from Oracle to Postgres. It's especially useful when application downtime is a concern. If you have an ongoing need and you need to use a change data capture mechanism, Replication Server can help.
-  Database links and foreign data wrappers (FDW). You can also use these technologies to help migrate data from an Oracle database. Where you use the Migration Toolkit and Replication Server tools to automatically push data from Oracle to Postgres, you use database links and FDWs to pull data from Oracle into Postgres.  Setup of DB links and FDWs and migration of data using them is more of a manual process.
-  Quick-deploy service. We’ll teach you how to deploy highly available, scalable, and secure environments in a way that makes implementing your PostgreSQL solution go faster. We’ll provide reference architecture and use a standards-based approach based on best practices.

\* For small data sets, use Migration Toolkit. If it's an Oracle migration into EDB Postgres Advanced Server, and the data set is large or if you notice slow data transfer, take advantage of one of the other data movement methods available:

-  Use the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database link feature compatible with Oracle databases.
-  If your data has BLOB or CLOB data, use the dblink_ora style database links instead of the Oracle style database links.

Both of these methods use the Oracle Call Interface (OCI) to connect to Oracle. After connecting, use an SQL statement to select the data from the “linked” Oracle database and insert the data into the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database.

### Migrate application and interfaces

For migrating the application and interfaces, we have these tools, which allow you to move the application code and generally reduce the changes you need to make:

-  EDB Postgres Advanced Server (Oracle-compatible Postgres)
-  Oracle-compatible database connectors
-  JDBC, ODBC, OCI, .NET
-  Embedded Postgres SME service

### Migrate reports and management tools

These tools and services help you to migrate your reports and manage your database:

-  EDB\*Plus. EDB\*Plus is a command line interface to EDB Postgres Advanced Server. EDB\*Plus accepts SQL commands, SPL anonymous blocks, and EDB\*Plus commands. EDB\*Plus commands are compatible with Oracle SQL\*Plus commands so you can use the scripts you've aleady built for Oracle against the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database.
-  EDB\*Loader. EDB\*Loader is a high-performance bulk data loader that provides an interface compatible with Oracle databases for EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The EDB\*Loader utility loads data from an input source, typically a file, into one or more tables using a subset of the parameters offered by Oracle SQL\*Loader.
-  Embedded Postgres SME service.

### Test the migration

To test the migration, use these tools and services: 

-  LiveCompare. LiveCompare compares any number of databases to verify they are identical. After comparing the databases, the tool generates a comparison report, a list of differences, and data manipulation language (DML) scripts. You can apply the DML and fix the inconsistencies in any of the databases.
-  Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM). PEM consists of components that provide the management and analytical functionality for your EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database. PEM is a comprehensive database design and management system. PEM simplifies creating, maintaining, and using database objects.
-  Embedded Postgres SME service.

### Optimize and configure post-migration system

To optimize and configure your system after migration, use these EDB tools and services: 

-  Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM). PEM helps you to manage and analyze your EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database. 
-  Barman. Barman (Backup and Recovery Manager) is an open-source administration tool for remote backups and disaster recovery of PostgreSQL servers. Configure backups after performing the migration.
-  EDB Failover Manager. EDB Failover Manager is a high-availability solution for managing Postgres database clusters, enabling high availability of primary-standby deployment architectures using streaming replication. Failover Manager provides a Postgres primary database node automatic failover to a standby database node in case of a software or hardware failure.
-  Postgres-BDR (bi-directional replication). BDR is a PostgreSQL extension providing multi-master replication and data distribution with advanced conflict management, data-loss protection, and throughput up to five times faster than native logical replication. It enables distributed PostgreSQL clusters with high availability up to five 9s. For more extreme high availability scenarios, we suggest Postgres-BDR versus EDB Failover Manager.
-  Performance tuning service.
-  Monitoring best practices service.
-  Backup best practices service.
-  Embedded Postgres SME service.

If you're migrating into an EDB Postgres Advanced Server database, take advantage of EDB Postgres Advanced Server's performance tuning utilities:

-  Use Dynatune to dynamically adjust database configuration resources.
-  Use Optimizer Hints to direct the query path.
-  Use the ANALYZE command to retrieve database statistics.

See [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](../epas/latest/) and [Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers](../epas/latest/epas_compat_tools_guide/) for information about the performance tuning tools available with EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

### Complete cutover/go live

These tools help with this phase: 

-  Replication Server. Replication server can help migrate data back to Oracle if needed.
-  LiveCompare. LiveCompare compares databases to verify they are identical. The tool compares the databases and generates a comparison report, a list of differences, and DML scripts so you can optionally apply the DML and fix the inconsistencies in any of the databases. This report helps you to know if you are ready to go live or if you still need to address inconsistencies. If you're migrating data back to Oracle for a fallback position, LiveCompare can make sure that the two databases have the same data.
-  Embedded Postgres SME service.
