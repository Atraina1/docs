As you assess the feasibility of the migration from Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server, youâ€™ll want to understand the similarities and differences between the two database technologies. EDB Postgres Advanced Server is an enhanced version of PostgreSQL that includes a number of built-in Oracle compatibility features.  Although these compatibility features make it more similar to Oracle than core PostgreSQL, differences still remain. The intent of the comparison that follows is to give you a feel for the capabilities and features provided by Oracle that will migrate automatically or with minimal effort and those that will require more effort.  

The following topics are covered in this comparison:
- [General characteristics](general_characteristics/)
- [Database features](database_features/)
- [Database operations-related capabilities](operational_capabilities)
- [Application development capabilities](app_devel_capabilities/)
- [Nonrelational data support](non_relational_data/)
- [Notable differences](notable_differences/)

Having this understanding will help you to decide if EDB Postgres Advanced Server is a good option to replace your Oracle database.
