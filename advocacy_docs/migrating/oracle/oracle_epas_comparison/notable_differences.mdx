A number of differences between Oracle and EDB Postgres Advanced Server are either not yet addressed or are worth noting because of their frequent use. 

| Oracle Enterprise            | EDB Postgres Advanced Server |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| MERGE                        | No <br/> Postgres UPSERT statements can be used but have different syntax from MERGE. <br/> MERGE syntax planned for PostgreSQL 15 | 
| Advanced queuing             | Yes                          |
| Nested procedures/functions  | Yes                          |
| Pipelined functions          | No <br/> Pipelined functions are used for table functions. Table functions can be implemented in Postgres via SETOF returning functions. In Postgres, data is returned only after the function completes. |
| Empty string = NULL          | No <br/> Empty string = !NULL         |
| Performs many implicit data type conversions such as a number to a string | Partial <br/> Many data types need to be explicitly cast to the other data type or an error occurs. |
