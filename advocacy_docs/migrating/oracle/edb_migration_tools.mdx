title: EDB tools for the migration journey
---

One advantage of performing the migration from Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server is the experience EDB has in performing these migrations. For each phase, we offer tools and services that make the migration easier. We can also discuss your business requirements and help you with the decision to migrate and which approach works best for you.

## Assess feasibility 

Use these tools and services to assess the feasibility of your migration:

-  Migration Portal. Business logic, mostly stored procedures, is generally seen as a major migration obstacle during manual migrations or when using the translation approach. Migration Portal is EDB’s tool, provided on a public website, that helps you to assess your Oracle data definition language for its ability to migrate to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.  
-  Migration assessment service. We offer a set of migration assessment services that perform a detailed analysis of your database. From that analysis, you'll learn how difficult the migration will be and how much time and effort it will take to perform the database migration.

See [Analyzing feasibility](analyzing_feasibility) for information on compatibility between Oracle and EDB Postgres Advanced Server. 

## Plan migration 

EDB provides services to help you to plan your migration. Our professional services team has packaged services that look at your enterprise architecture and environment to help you understand what your needs are and then design a solution for you. These services include:

-  Migration assessment
-  Enterprise architecture
-  Solution design

## Migrate schema, code, and data 

For migrating the schema, the following EDB tools and services will help:
 
-  EDB Postgres Advanced Server. Compatibility with Oracle simplifies the migration. EDB Postgres Advanced Server compatibility features mean there will be fewer things to convert because things that worked in Oracle will work in EDB Postgres Advanced Server.
-  Migration Portal. In addition to providing assessment reports, the Migration Portal can convert an Oracle schema to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server-compatible version and has features to help load that schema into an EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance.
-  Migration Toolkit\*. Migration Toolkit helps with migrating database objects and data to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database from Oracle. 
-  Replication Server. EDB Postgres Replication Server provides a robust data platform that replicates from non-PostgreSQL databases to PostgreSQL in single-master mode. You can use it as an alternative to Migration Toolkit for migrating data from Oracle to Postgres. It's especially useful when application downtime is a concern. If you have an ongoing need and you need to use a change data capture mechanism, Replication Server can help.
-  Database links and foreign data wrappers (FDW). You can also use these technologies to help migrate data from an Oracle database. Where you use the Migration Toolkit and Replication Server tools to automatically push data from Oracle to Postgres, you use database links and FDWs to pull data from Oracle into Postgres.  Setup of DB links and FDWs and migration of data using them is more of a manual process.
-  Quick-deploy service. We’ll teach you how to deploy highly available, scalable, and secure environments in a way that makes implementing your PostgreSQL solution go faster. We’ll provide reference architecture and use a standards-based approach based on best practices.

\* For small data sets, use Migration Toolkit. If it's an Oracle migration into EDB Postgres Advanced Server, and the data set is large or if you notice slow data transfer, take advantage of one of the other data movement methods available:

-  Use the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database link feature compatible with Oracle databases.
-  If your data has BLOB or CLOB data, use the dblink_ora style database links instead of the Oracle style database links.

Both of these methods use the Oracle Call Interface (OCI) to connect to Oracle. After connecting, use an SQL statement to select the data from the “linked” Oracle database and insert the data into the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database.

## Migrate application and interfaces

For migrating the application and interfaces, we have these tools, which allow you to move the application code and generally reduce the changes you need to make:

-  EDB Postgres Advanced Server (Oracle-compatible Postgres)
-  Oracle-compatible database connectors
-  JDBC, ODBC, OCI, .NET
-  Embedded Postgres SME service

## Migrate reports and management tools

These tools and services help you to migrate your reports and manage your database:

-  EDB\*Plus. EDB\*Plus is a command line interface to EDB Postgres Advanced Server. EDB\*Plus accepts SQL commands, SPL anonymous blocks, and EDB\*Plus commands. EDB\*Plus commands are compatible with Oracle SQL\*Plus commands so you can use the scripts you've aleady built for Oracle against the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database.
-  EDB\*Loader. EDB\*Loader is a high-performance bulk data loader that provides an interface compatible with Oracle databases for EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The EDB\*Loader utility loads data from an input source, typically a file, into one or more tables using a subset of the parameters offered by Oracle SQL\*Loader.
-  Embedded Postgres SME service.

## Test the migration

To test the migration, use these tools and services: 

-  LiveCompare. LiveCompare compares any number of databases to verify they are identical. After comparing the databases, the tool generates a comparison report, a list of differences, and data manipulation language (DML) scripts. You can apply the DML and fix the inconsistencies in any of the databases.
-  Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM). PEM consists of components that provide the management and analytical functionality for your EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database. PEM is a comprehensive database design and management system. PEM simplifies creating, maintaining, and using database objects.
-  Embedded Postgres SME service.

## Optimize and configure post-migration system

To optimize and configure your system after migration, use these EDB tools and services: 

-  Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM). PEM helps you to manage and analyze your EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database. 
-  Barman. Barman (Backup and Recovery Manager) is an open-source administration tool for remote backups and disaster recovery of PostgreSQL servers. Configure backups after performing the migration.
-  EDB Failover Manager. EDB Failover Manager is a high-availability solution for managing Postgres database clusters, enabling high availability of primary-standby deployment architectures using streaming replication. Failover Manager provides a Postgres primary database node automatic failover to a standby database node in case of a software or hardware failure.
-  Postgres-BDR (bi-directional replication). BDR is a PostgreSQL extension providing multi-master replication and data distribution with advanced conflict management, data-loss protection, and throughput up to five times faster than native logical replication. It enables distributed PostgreSQL clusters with high availability up to five 9s. For more extreme high availability scenarios, we suggest Postgres-BDR versus EDB Failover Manager.
-  Performance tuning service.
-  Monitoring best practices service.
-  Backup best practices service.
-  Embedded Postgres SME service.

If you're migrating into an EDB Postgres Advanced Server database, take advantage of EDB Postgres Advanced Server's performance tuning utilities:

-  Use Dynatune to dynamically adjust database configuration resources.
-  Use Optimizer Hints to direct the query path.
-  Use the ANALYZE command to retrieve database statistics.

See [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](../epas/latest/) and [Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers](../epas/latest/epas_compat_tools_guide/) for information about the performance tuning tools available with EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

## Complete cutover/go live

These tools help with this phase: 

-  Replication Server. Replication server can help migrate data back to Oracle if needed.
-  LiveCompare. LiveCompare compares databases to verify they are identical. The tool compares the databases and generates a comparison report, a list of differences, and DML scripts so you can optionally apply the DML and fix the inconsistencies in any of the databases. This report helps you to know if you are ready to go live or if you still need to address inconsistencies. If you're migrating data back to Oracle for a fallback position, LiveCompare can make sure that the two databases have the same data.
-  Embedded Postgres SME service.
