As you assess the feasibility of the migration from Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS), youâ€™ll want to understand the similarities and differences between the two database technologies.  EDB Postgres Advanced Server is an enhanced version of PostgreSQL that includes a number of built-in Oracle compatibility features.  Although these compatibility features make it more similar to Oracle than core PostgreSQL, differences still remain.  The intent of the comparison provided in this documentation is to give you a feel for which capabilities and features provided by Oracle should migrate automatically or with minimal effort and which will require more effort.  

The following topics are covered in this comparison:
- [General Characteristics](/general_characteristics.mdx)
- [Database Features](/technical_compatibilities.mdx)
- [Database Operations Related Capabilities](/nonfunctional_compatibilities.mdx)
- [Application Development Capabilities](/application_devel_compatibilities.mdx)
- [Non-Relational Data Support](/big_unstructured_data.mdx)
- [Notable Differences](/incompatibilities.mdx)

Having this understanding will help you to be able to decide if EPAS is a good option to replace your Oracle database. This information is also useful in planning the work that may be required to migrate your database to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.  After you've decided to migrate to EPAS, you can refer to the Knowledge Base available in the [Migration Portal](https://migration.enterprisedb.com/) *Portal Wiki* tab for more detailed workarounds of common migration issues.
