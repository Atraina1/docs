title: Determine the platform				
---

These are the platforms or deployment possibilities you might be migrating from or to:

-  On premises. You can deploy on the following in an on-premises environment:
    - Dedicated hardware. This was the standard for many years. In this enviroment, database software runs directly on the physical machine. This provided the most performant capabilities.
    - Virtual machines (VMs). VMs came after dedicated hardware. You can tune virtual machines to perform as well as the physical servers. 
    - Containers. The databases industry is starting to adopt containers, but this platform is not as far along as the physical servers and VMs. 
    - Private cloud. You can take these building blocks and build a private cloud. Some organizations  are big enough to have private clouds using different technologies. Even though it's not exposed to the public, it operates like a cloud in their environments.

-  Kupernetes/containers. Containers are like a smaller version of a virtual machine. They isolate things down to running certain applications. As you start to use those containers, you need a way to orchestrate which ones is the primary container to use versus replicas that are used for other purposes. The industry has standardized on Kupernetes for this purpose, so being able to deploy a database in a Kubernetes environment is important. EDB provides capabilities for that, so that you can run Kubernetes environments on premises or in the cloud. 
-  Public cloud infrastructure as a service. This environment is similar to running a virtual machine but in the cloud. Public cloud infrastructure as a service is essentially virtual machines running in the cloud. You can deploy databases there, including Postgres and EDB Postgres Advanced Server. 
-  Database as a service. In this case, you're unaware of the machine that the databases are running on: it's a service that you interact with. The management of the underlying database, such as configuration, is handled by the service. EDB, with Big Animal, has the option of providing a database of the service version of Postgres.

Any of these could also be migration sources. You could be moving from a database that's running on premises or in containers. Perhaps you have a development environment that you want to put into a production environment. You might be moving from a Kupernetes container source to something else.

Some organization's first foray into the cloud was to run databases and applications in an infrastructure as a service environment. That also might be a source. Or, sometimes organizations use databases as a service offerings by other vendors that they are unhappy with. They might want to migrate from that enviroment. For example, you might want to migrate from Amazon's Oracle RDS into something running Postgres.

When migrating databases to the cloud, you have several options:			

-  Private cloud, such as OpenShift, Nutanix, or VMWare	
-  Public cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS), such as AWS EC2 or GCP
-  Public cloud Kubernetes Platforms, such GKE, AKS, or EKS
-  Public cloud database as a service (DBaaS), such as RDS Postgres, Aurora for Postgres, Azure Database for Postgres, Google’s Cloud SQL for Postgres, or EDB’s Cloud BigAnimal
 							
While they all implement the Postgres API, there are key differences in migration capabilities.
 							
EDB’s native compatibility with Oracle is available on OpenShift, VMWare, all IaaS and K8s platforms, and on EDB’s BigAnimal. RDS, Aurora, Azure Database for Postgres, Google’s Cloud SQL for Postgres are limited to the translation approach.
 							
From a nonfunctional perspective, IaaS, VMWare, OpenShift and K8s platforms provide the highest level of control for performance, manageability, and integration, but they also require in-house deployment and management resources. Leading DBaaS platforms address these issues, but they limit configurability for nonfunctional requirements.

When selecting a cloud platform, think about your future needs. Initial migrations might be served well by a DBaaS provided by a cloud service provider such as AWS or Azure, for whom Postgres is just another software platform that they operate. More advanced applications might need greater access to tuning parameters, as provided on IaaS platforms or the services of a Postgres specialist such as EDB.
