VisionX is a tool for the efficient development of web, mobile, and desktop applications. It focuses on database-driven applications for businesses that facilitate data management and support processes. The resulting applications are based on open-source frameworks, such as JVx, Vaadin, Apache POI, iText and others. 

VisionX covers the entire application development process, which includes the data model design, the user interfaces, the business logic, the creation of reports, the import and export of data (EXCEL, CSV, XML), the access via web services, and much more. 

VisionX low-code platform is also a good replacement for Oracle APEX low-code platform with PostgreSQL.
