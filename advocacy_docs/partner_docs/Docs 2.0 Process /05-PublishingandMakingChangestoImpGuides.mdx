The tutorial on how to push changes in GitHub goes into greater detail on publishing and making changes to the guides and can be found (here)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JwCuDdK1txupwg9cCLsDi_uXv8fj8ANYw2L3oeuI-Z8/edit?usp=sharing]. 

1. Create a new branch in order to store any changes that you need to make to the implementation guide by clicking on the Branch menu, “New Branch”, and then “Create Branch”.

2. Publish the branch so that you can eventually create a pull request, have it reviewed by your team, and get it approved for publishing.

3. Save all the changes you made to the implementation guide by saving the folder in your branch. 
4. Make sure your branch is refreshed. In your terminal, run the following commands in order to do so: 
    a. **If you've no local changes or commits:** git reset --hard (branch name)
    b. **If you do:** git pull --rebase 

5. Once any changes have been made, click on the blue “Commit to ‘...’ “ in order to commit them to the branch that you have created.

6. Once the changes have been committed, press the “Push Origin” button in order to push the changes to the repository. 
7. Go to the GitHub enterprise website and find the copy of the docs repository that you had created. 
8. Click on the drop-down list of branches to find the one to which you had committed changes. 
9. Find the one that has the implementation guide(s) that you’re trying to publish. 
10. Once you have found the correct branch, click on the “Create Pull Request” button in order to have your changes reviewed and approved to be merged with the main develop branch. 
11. Reach out to a member from the Docs team and have him/her added as a reviewer of the Pull Request under the Reviewers section on the right side of the page. 
12. Add your teammates (if any) so that they can be able to review your changes as well.

13. At the bottom of the Pull Request page, you should be given an option to make the Pull Request ready for review. 
14. Your reviewer will review the Pull Request, make suggested changes if there are any, and will be able to merge it for publication. 
15. If you want to see how the guide looks in the developer environment, put a “deploy” label on the pull request and a website link to the guide in the developer environment will be generated within 30-45 minutes.
