The directions on how to install and run Markdown on MacOS can be viewed in greater detail and found at https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/docs/blob/develop/README.md but here is a brief overview: 

1. Ensure that you have access to GitHub on your Okta account. If you don’t have it, contact the IT Helpdesk (helpdesk@enterprisedb.com) to request access to GitHub.

2. Install Homebrew on your computer, if you already don’t have it. 
3. Get permission from the IT Helpdesk to access the Docs repository on GitHub. 
4. Install git and git-lfs using Homebrew with command ``brew install git git-lfs``.
5. Set up an SSH key on GitHub (https://github.com/settings/keys), follow the instructions on the following page to set it up: 
https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
6. Clone the Docs repository to your computer through GitHub desktop. 
7. Navigate to the cloned repo directory in your Terminal and create a .env.development file: ``cp env.development.example .env.development``
8. Install Docker on your computer using the command  ``brew install --cask docker``

If you get a message saying that you already have Docker installed, check which version is installed using these commands
``brew ls --formula docker``  and    ``brew ls --cask docker``

If the first command yields results, enter the following command to uninstall the formula version and to install the cask version
``brew uninstall -f docker && brew install --cask docker``

9. If you're a member of the EnterpriseDB Github Org, follow the instructions below to enable icons in the docs application.

https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
Create a Github token which can pull private packages.

  a. The minimum scope the token requires is read:packages
  b. Make sure to enable SSO for your token or it may not work correctly

10. Once you have that token, update your .env.development file with this line: 
``NPM_TOKEN=your-token-here``. That will be utilized in the NPM_TOKEN variable in the .npmrc file.

11. Go to Applications Folder on your computer and open the Docker Application.

12. Execute command ``docker --version`` and if the following error is displayed then restart the Docker application.
	``zsh: command not found``

13. Create your own branch in GitHub desktop in order to ensure that you have your own local copy of the docs repo that you can use in order to create your documents in the Docs 2.0 standard format while making sure that it doesn’t interfere with what gets published online.

The end result should be that you have a local copy of the docs repo in a local folder that you created, as shown on the left side of the screenshot below:
