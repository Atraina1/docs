More information on how to use Markdown syntax to write documents can be found at https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/ but here is a brief overview: 

1. Once you have cloned the Docs repository and have set up the Markdown environment in Visual Studio Code, create a folder in which you’ll create the implementation and another folder within that for the images you’ll include in the guide. 
2. 
3. Create a file titled index.mdx. This file will serve as the homepage for your implementation guide in Markdown. You must include a header that gives a title for the document (ex: “title: 'Thales Implementation Guide' “), indicates that several files will be brought together (“indexCards: simple”), and has an icon that will be used on the left side of the guide (“iconName: handshake”). Look at  the image below for example of an index.mdx file: 

<p align="center">
  <img  src="Images/SampleIndexFile.png">
</p>

3. In that same index.mdx file, insert the Partner Program image using the html syntax displayed in the image above. Then, utilize the code below the image syntax to indicate that this is an EDB GlobalConnect Technology Partner implementation guide and mention the name of the company and the product underneath that. 

4. Each section of the implementation guide should be written up in their own .mdx file and should be marked with a number at the beginning in order to organize them as they were in the pdf version. 
    a. For example, the Thales Implementation Guide has the following sections:
        i. Partner Information
        ii. Solution Summary
        iii. Implementing CipherTrust Transparent Encryption (CTE)
        iv. Using CipherTrust Transparent Encryption (CTE)
        v. Certification Environment
        vi. Appendix

    b. These sections should be recreated as their own .mdx files within the guide folder as saved as “02-PartnerInformation.mdx”, “03-SolutionSummary.mdx”, and so forth so that they get ordered. 
    c. This is how a folder for an implementation guide recreated in Markdown should look: 
    <p align="center">
    <img  src="Images/ImplementationGuideFolder.png">
    </p>
    d. Set the title as “(company) Implementation Guide” in the index.mdx file of the folder (ex: “title: Thales Implementation Guide”)
    e. This is how the implementation guide should look on your local host:
    <p align="center">
    <img  src="Images/ImpGuideLocalHost.png">
    </p>
    <div align="center">*Notice that the sections of the Implementation Guide are ordered as they are in the PDF after having the numbering in the title of the .mdx file.*</div>
    f. Create a box for the Implementation Guides on your local host of the Docs homepage and title it **Third Party Integrations**
        i. Go to the **index.js** file under the **pages** subfolder within the **src** folder
        ii. Implement the following syntax in order to create the box:
        <p align="center">
        <img  src="Images/ImpGuideLocalHost.png">
        </p>
        iii. List the guides in alphabetical order. 
        iv. Make sure that the **Third Party Integrations** box is the last box, it should be the last one coded after all the other ones in the index file.
