1. Go to the page of the pull request you created on GitHub Enterprise, click on the “Files Changed” tab, and you’ll see a green button on the right titled “Review Changes”.

2. Once you click that button, you’ll be given 3 options that will allow you to review and comment on the guides themselves: 
    **Commenting:** Submitting general feedback without explicit approval
    **Approving:** Submitting feedback and approving the merging of these changes. 
    **Requesting changes:** Submitting feedback that must be addressed before merging

3. Once these changes have been approved by those who have been asked to review the document and there are no conflicts within the branch, then the branch is ready to be merged in with the develop branch.
