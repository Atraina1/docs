1. Create a copy of the develop branch while keeping the docs repository as your current repository in GitHub desktop.

2. Name the branch however you would like, although it would be good practice to incorporate the name of the guide that you’re making changes to. 
3. Go back into Visual Studio Code, go into the partner_docs folder within the advocacy_docs folder and find the file of the implementation guide you’re making changes to.
4. Make your needed changes to the file, save it, and then go back to GitHub Desktop. 
5. Whatever changes you have made to the file will show up in the changes section on the left side, click on the blue “Commit to” button at the bottom to commit these changes to your branch.

6. Once you’ve committed your changes to the branch, click on the blue “Publish branch” button to create a pull request that will be reviewed and merged, pending approval.
