<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Docs 2.0 Process</h1>

The Docs 2.0 process involves taking PDFs of implementation guides put together by partners and edited by the Tech Partner team and converting them to Markdown files in order to take advantage of the EDB Docs formatting and having it published on the Docs homepage. This document explains the process in stages that take the user from installing Markdown on his or her OS all the way through to creating a Pull Request that sends out the implementation guide for publishing.
