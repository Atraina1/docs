# Installing Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper 13 on Debian 9 x86_64

There are three steps to completing an installation:

- Setting up the repository(#setting-up-the-repository)
- Installing the package(#installing-the-package)
- Performing the initial configuration(#initial-config)

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

Before setting up the repository, you need to register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

## Setting up the Repository

# Setup the Repository by replacing 'USERNAME:PASSWORD' below with your username and password for the EDB repositories

```shell
echo "deb https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list
```

This creates the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-stretch.list configuration file.

# Add support for secure APT repositories:

apt-get -y install apt-transport-https

# Replace '<USERNAME>':'<PASSWORD>' with your repository username and password available from your [EDB account](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user) and add the EDB signing key:

wget -q -O - https://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -

# Update the repository meta data:

apt-get update

## Installing the Package
