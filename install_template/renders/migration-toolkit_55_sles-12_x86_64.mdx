title: Installing Migration Toolkit on SLES 12 x86_64

To complete an installation:

- [Setting up the repository](#setting-up-the-repository)
- [Installing the package](#installing-the-package)

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

Before setting up the repository, you need to register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

## Setting up the repository

Setting up the repository is a one time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform these steps.

!!! Note
The following set of commands is designed to let you copy and paste the commands into a terminal window. The `printf` commands prompt you to enter registration information interactively. Alternatively, for a non-interactive approach, you can remove the `printf` commands and replace `$SUSE_REGISTRATION_CODE` and `$SUSE_EMAIL` in the registration command (`SUSEConnect -r`) with your registration information.
!!!

```shell
# Install the repository configuration and enter your EDB repository
# credentials when prompted
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access
# to SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# Store your SUSE registration information
printf "Enter SUSE subscription registration code: " && read -r SUSE_REGISTRATION_CODE
printf "Enter SUSE subscription email: " && read -r SUSE_EMAIL

# Register the host with SUSE using your stored information,
# which allows access to SUSE repositories.
SUSEConnect -r $SUSE_REGISTRATION_CODE -e $SUSE_EMAIL

# Activate the required SUSE modules
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/x86_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/x86_64

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh
```

## Installing the package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-migrationtoolkit
```
