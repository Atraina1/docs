# Installing Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper 12 on SLES 12 x86_64

There are three steps to completing an installation:

- Setting up the repository(#setting-up-the-repository)
- Installing the package(#installing-the-package)
- Performing the initial configuration(#initial-config)

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

Before setting up the repository, you need to register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

## Setting up the Repository

```shell
# Install the repository configuration
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# Store your SUSE registration information for use by the next command.
# For non-interactive scenarios, remove these lines and
# replace $SUSE_REGISTRATION_CODE and $SUSE_EMAIL with your registration information
printf "Enter SUSE subscription registration code: " && read -r SUSE_REGISTRATION_CODE
printf "Enter SUSE subscription email: " && read -r SUSE_EMAIL

# Register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
SUSEConnect -r $REGISTRATION_CODE -e $EMAIL

# Activate the Package Hub and SDK packages
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/x86_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/x86_64

# Refresh the metadata
