# Installing MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper 14 on CentOS 7 x86_64

There are three steps to completing an installation:

- Setting up the repository(#setting-up-the-repository)
- Installing the package(#installing-the-package)
- Performing the initial configuration(#initial-config)

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

Before setting up the repository, you need to register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

## Setting up the Repository

```shell
# Set up the EDB repository:
yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm

# This creates the /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo configuration file.

#  Replace `'USERNAME:PASSWORD'` below with your username and password available from your
[EDB account](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user) in the edb.repo file:
sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo

#  Install EPEL repository and refresh the cache:
yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
yum makecache
```

## Installing the Package

```shell
yum -y install edb-as14-mysql8_fdw
```

!!! Note
Once the edb repository is set up, you can install any of the EDB products by using the relevant package name at this step. You can use `yum list available` command to check the available packages.
