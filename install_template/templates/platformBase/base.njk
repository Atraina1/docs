## Set up the repository
Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step. If you do need to set up the repository, you must register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).
