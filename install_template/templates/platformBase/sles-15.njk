Setting up the repository is a one time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform these steps.

!!! Note
    The following set of commands is designed to let you copy and paste the commands into a terminal window. The `printf` commands prompt you to enter registration information interactively. Alternatively, for a non-interactive approach, you can remove the `printf` commands and replace `$SUSE_REGISTRATION_CODE` and `$SUSE_EMAIL` in the registration command (`SUSEConnect -r`) with your registration information.

```shell
# Install the repository configuration and enter your EDB repository
# credentials when prompted
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access 
# to SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# Store your SUSE registration information
printf "Enter SUSE subscription registration code: " && read -r SUSE_REGISTRATION_CODE
printf "Enter SUSE subscription email: " && read -r SUSE_EMAIL

# Register the host with SUSE using your stored information,
# which allows access to SUSE repositories.
SUSEConnect -r $SUSE_REGISTRATION_CODE -e $SUSE_EMAIL

# Activate the required SUSE module
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.3/{{ platform.arch }}

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh
```
